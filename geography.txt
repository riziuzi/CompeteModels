• The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country dividing it into two latitudinal halves.

• The area to the north of Tropic of Cancer is near twice the area which lies to the south of it.

• South of 22° north latitude, the country tapers off over 800 km into the Indian Ocean as a peninsula.

• East-West time difference is nearly 2 hrs. (A difference of 1° longitude will make a difference of 4 minutes
in time. ~30 x 4 = ~120 minutes or ~2 hours).

India, Tropical or Temperate Country?

• The temperate part (north of Tropic of Cancer) is twice the area of the tropical part.

• But India has always been treated as a tropical country for two different reasons – physical and cultural.

Physical Geographical (Climatic) Reasons
• The country is separated from the rest of Asia by the Himalayas.

• The tropical monsoons dominate its climate.

• Himalayas blocks the cold temperate air masses.

• Although winter night temperatures are low, yet clear skies and intense insolation raise the day tempera-
tures to a tropical level.

Cultural Geographical Reasons
• Settlements, diseases, agricultural and primary economic activities are all tropical in nature.

It is primarily because of the Himalayas that India is a predominantly tropical country.

1.2 India's Frontiers
Data from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Department of Border Management)
• India has 15106.7 Km of land border running through 17 States.

1382
• Indian has a coastline of 7516.6 Km (6100 km of mainland coastline + coastline of 1197 Indian islands)
touching 13 States and Union Territories (UTs).

• Barring Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Haryana, all other States in the
country have one or more international borders or a coastline and can be regarded as frontline States
from the point of view of border management.

• India's longest border is with Bangladesh while the shortest border is with Afghanistan.

• The length of India’s land borders with neighbouring countries is given in the table below.

Border with China
• This is the second longest border of India, next only to its border with Bangladesh.

• Five Indian states, namely Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pra-
desh touch the Indian boundary with China.

• The Sino-Indian border is generally divided into three sectors namely: (i) the Western sector, (ii) the Middle
sector, and (iii) the Eastern sector.

The Western Sector
• Separates Jammu and Kashmir state of India from the Xinjiang province of China.

• The western sector boundary is largely the outcome of the British policy towards the state of Jammu and
Kashmir.

• China claims the Aksai Chin, the Changmo valley, Pangong Tso and the Sponggar Tso area of north-
east Ladakh.

• China also claims a part of Huza-Gilgit area in North Kashmir (ceded to it in 1963 by Pakistan).

The Middle Sector
• Two Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand touch this border.

The Eastern Sector
• The 1,140 km long boundary between India and China runs from the eastern limit of Bhutan to a point near
Diphu pass (Talu-Pass) at the tri-junction of India, Tibet and Myanmar.

Diphu Pass is a mountain pass around the area of the disputed tri-point borders of India, China, and Myanmar.

It is Talu pass on the Burmese side, and Diphu pass on the Indian (Tibetan) side.

• This line is usually referred to as the Mc Mahon Line after Sir Henry Mc Mahon, then foreign secretary of
British India, who negotiated the boundary agreement between Great Britain and Tibet at Shimla accord in
1913-14.

The India-Nepal Boundary
• Five states of India, namely Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim touch the Nepalese
border with India.

• The border is a porous one with an unrestricted movement of goods and people between Indian and Ne-
pal.

• Major portion of Indo-Nepalese border runs in the east-west direction almost along the foothill of the Shi-
walik Range.

The Indo-Pakistan Boundary
• The Indo-Pakistan boundary is the result of the partition of the country in 1947 under the Radcliffe award
of which Sir Cyril Radcliffe was the chairman.

• Jammu and Kashmir, Sir Creek are the major disputed regions.


Creeks in the Kutch Region
The India-Bangladesh Border
• India's 4,096 km long border with Bangladesh is the longest.

9


• This boundary has been determined under the Radcliffe Award which divided the erstwhile province of
Bengal into two parts.

India-Myanmar Boundary
• This boundary runs roughly along the watershed between the Brahmaputra and Irrawaddy rivers.

• It passes through thickly forested regions, with Mizo Hills, Manipur and Nagaland on the Indian side and
Chin Hills, Naga Hills and Kachin state on the Myanmar side.

India-Sri Lanka Boundary
• India and Sri Lanka are separated from each other by a narrow and shallow sea called Palk Strait.

• Dhanushkodi on the Tamil Nadu coast in India is only 32 km away from Talaimanar in Jaffna peninsula in
Sri Lanka. These two points are joined by a group of islets forming Rama Setu (Adam's Bridge).

1.3 Major Physical Divisions of India
1. The Himalayas (young fold mountains),
2. Indo-Gangetic Plain (monotonous topography – featureless topography),
3. The Peninsular Plateau (one of the most stable landmasses; one of the oldest plateaus of the world),
4. Coastal Plains (sedimentation due to fluvial action).

5. The Indian Islands (Coral Islands ➔ coral reef built up on atolls. E.g. Lakshadweep Islands. Tectonic
➔ Andaman and Nicobar Islands – Interaction between the Indian Plate and Eurasian plate).

10


Physical Map of India
Peninsular Plateau
• Includes entire south India, central India, Aravallis, Rajmahal hills, Meghalaya plateau, Kutch-Kathiawar
region (Gujarat) etc.

• It is the oldest and the most stable landmass of India.

Himalayas
11


• Includes the Himalayas, Purvanchal and their extensions Arakan Yoma (Myanmar) and Andaman and
Nicobar Islands (but we consider these as islands only).

• It is the youngest and highly unstable landmass of India. (Continent-Continent Convergence)
• Tectonic movements are widespread.

Indo-Gangetic Plain
• The monotonous region (featureless topography) between Peninsular and Himalayan region.

• Most youthful region prone to tectonic forces.

Coastal Plains
• Eastern Coastal Plains and Western Coastal Plains.

• It is formed due to the consolidation of sediments brought by rivers (fluvial deposits).

• Highly stable just like the peninsular plateau.

Indian Islands
• Two major groups – Lakshadweep (coral islands) and, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (tectonic islands).

• Lakshadweep (part of Reunion Hotspot Volcanic chain) are a group of atolls occupied by coral reefs.

• There has been no significant volcanism or tectonic activity in the recent past.

• The islands are highly vulnerable to sea-level rise.

• Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a continuation of Arakan Yoma.

• The islands have volcanoes (Barren Island is the only active volcano) and are tectonically active.

Geologic Time Scale:
https://www.pmfias.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Precambrian-Supereon-Geological-Time-Scale.jpg
https://www.pmfias.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Phanerozoic-Eon-Geological-Time-Scale.jpg
2.1 Archaean Rock System (Pre-Cambrian Rocks)
• Rocks formed prior to the Cambrian system.

• The Archaean rock system includes:
Archaean Gneisses and Schists (4 billion years old)
Gneiss ➔ Mineral composition varies from granite to gabbro.

Schists ➔ mostly crystalline, include mica, talc, hornblende, chlorite, etc.

• Oldest rocks (formed in the pre-Cambrian era – about 4 billion years ago).

• These rocks were formed due to solidification of molten magma – the earth’s surface was very hot then.

• They are known as the ‘Basement Complex’ (they are the oldest and forms the base for new layers)
• They are azoic or unfossiliferous plutonic intrusions (magma solidified below the surface).

• They are foliated (consisting of thin sheets).

• They are thoroughly crystalline (because they are volcanic in origin).

Dharwar System (1 to 4 billion years old)
• Formation period ranges from 4 billion years ago to – 1 billion years ago.

• They are highly metamorphosed sedimentary rock-system (formed due to the metamorphosis of sedi-
ments of Archaean gneisses and schists).

• They are the oldest metamorphosed rocks.

• They are found in abundance in the Dharwar district of Karnataka.

• They are economically the most important rocks because they possess valuable minerals like high-grade
iron-ore, manganese, copper, lead, gold, etc.

Purana Rock System (600 to 1400 million years old)
• Includes two divisions: the Cuddapah System and the Vindhyan System.

Cuddapah System
15


• Unfossiliferous clay, slates, sandstones and limestones was deposited in synclinal basins (depression be-
tween two folds).

• Outcrops best observed in Cuddapah district of Andhra Pradesh.

• These rocks contain ores of iron, manganese, copper, cobalt, nickel, etc.

• They contain large deposits of cement grade limestones.

Vindhyan System
• This system derives its name from the great Vindhyan mountains.

• The system comprises of ancient sedimentary rocks (4000 m thick) superimposed on the Archaean base.

• They are mostly unfossiliferous.

• A large area of this belt is covered by the Deccan Traps.

• The Vindhyan system have diamond bearing regions from which Panna and Golconda diamonds have
been mined.

• It is devoid of metalliferous minerals but provides large quantities of durable stones, ornamental stones,
limestone, pure glassmaking sand etc.

2.2 Dravidian Rock System (Palaeozoic)
• Formed about 600 – 300 million years ago.

• Found in the extra-Peninsular region (the Himalayas and Ganga plain) and are very rare in Peninsular
India. (The name ‘Dravidian’ doesn’t mean they are found in South India)
• They are sedimentary rocks, and abundant fossils can be found in them.

• The rocks of Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous periods fall under the Dravidian
system.

Carboniferous rocks (350 million years)
• The Carboniferous rocks (350 million years) comprise mainly of limestone, shale and quartzite.

• Mount Everest is composed of Upper Carboniferous limestones.

• Coal formation started in the Carboniferous age.

• Carboniferous in geology means coal bearing. (most of the coal found in India is not of the
Carboniferous period; High-quality coal of Great Lakes Region-USA, U.K and Ruhr region is Carbonif-
erous coal).

16


2.3 Aryan Rock System
• Upper Carboniferous to the Recent.

Gondwana System
• The Gondwana System (derives its name Gonds, tribes from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh)
• They are deposits laid down in synclinal troughs on ancient plateau surface.

• As the sediments accumulated, the loaded troughs subsided.

• Freshwater and sediments accumulated in these trough and terrestrial plants and animals thrived.

• This happened since the Permian period (250 million years ago).

Gondwana Coal
• Gondwana rocks contain nearly 98 per cent of India’s coal reserves.

• Gondwana coal is much younger than the Carboniferous coal, and hence its carbon content is low.

• They have rich deposits of iron ore, copper, uranium and antimony.

• Sandstones, slates and conglomerates are used as building materials.

Jurassic System
• The marine transgression in the latter part of the Jurassic gave rise to a thick series of shallow water de-
posits in Rajasthan and in Kutch.

• Coral limestone, sandstone, conglomerates and shales occur in Kutch.

• Another transgression on the east coast of the Peninsula is found between Guntur and Rajahmundry.

Deccan Trap
• The volcanic outburst over a vast area of Peninsular India from the end of the Cretaceous till the beginning
of the Eocene gave rise to Deccan Traps.

• Basaltic lava flowed out of fissures covering a vast area of about ten lakh km2.

• These volcanic deposits have a flat top and steep sides and therefore called ‘trap’ meaning a ‘stair’ or ‘step’
in Swedish.

• The process of weathering and erosion (denudation) since millions of years has reduced the Deccan Trap to
almost half of its original size.

17


• At present Deccan Traps covers about 5 lakh km2 mainly in parts of Kutch, Saurashtra, Maharashtra, the
Malwa plateau and northern Karnataka.

• The thickness of the Deccan Traps is 3,000 metres along the west which is reduced to 600-800 metres to-
wards the south, 800 metres in Kutch and only 150 metres at the eastern limit.

• The weathering of these rocks for a long time has given birth to black cotton soil known as regur.

The Deccan Trap has been divided into three groups:
Group
Found in
Inter-trappean beds
Layers of volcanic ash
The Upper Trap
Maharashtra and Saurashtra Present
Present
The Middle Trap
Central India and Malwa
Very rare to absent
Present
The Lower Trap
Madhya Pradesh
Present
Very rare to absent
• In basaltic volcanism (Deccan traps, Siberian shield, Laurentian shield), some sediments settle on the
cooled and solidified basaltic layer.

• This sediment layer is covered further by basaltic volcanism and again some sediments settle over it.

• These successive layers of sediments separated by the basalt are called inter-trappean beds.

Tertiary System
• Formed between Eocene to Pliocene (60 to 7 million years ago).

• The tertiary is the most significant period in India's geological history because the Himalayas were born,
and India's present form came into being in this period.

3. Himalayan Ranges
Division of the Himalayas
1. The Shiwaliks or The Outer Himalayas
2. The Lesser Himalayas or The Middle Himalayas or The Himachal
3. The Greater Himalayas or The Himadri
4. The Trans-Himalayas – Tibetan Himalayas
5. The Eastern Hills – Purvanchal: A chain of hills in North-East India
• Himalayan ranges are a series of several parallel or converging ranges.

• The ranges are separated by deep valleys creating a highly dissected topography (plateau or upland di-
vided by a number of deep valleys).

18


• The southern slopes have steep gradients, and northern slopes have comparatively gentler slopes.

Scaling Mount Everest is less hectic from the northern side. But China places restrictions, so climbers take the
steeper southern slopes from Nepal.

• Most of the Himalayan ranges fall in India, Nepal and Bhutan. The northern slopes are partly situated in Ti-
bet (trans-Himalayas) while the western extremity lies in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia.

• The Himalayas between Tibet and Ganga Plain is a succession of three parallel ranges.

3.2 Shiwalik Range
• Also known as The Outer Himalayas.

• Located in between the Great Plains and Lesser Himalayas.

• The altitude varies from 600 to 1500 metres.

• Runs for a distance of 2,400 km from the Potwar Plateau (west) to the Brahmaputra valley (east).

• The southern slopes are steep while the northern slopes are gentle.

• The width of the Shiwaliks varies from 50 km in Himachal Pradesh to less than 15 km in Arunachal
Pradesh.

• They are an almost unbroken chain of low hills except for a gap of 80-90 km which is occupied by the valley
of the Tista River and Raidak River.

• Shiwalik range from North-East India up to Nepal are covered with thick forests, but the forest cover de-
creases towards west from Nepal (because of the decrease in the quantum of rainfall from east to west).

• The southern slopes of Shiwalik range in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh are almost devoid of forest cover.

• These slopes are highly dissected by seasonal streams called Chos.

• Valleys are part of synclines and hills are part of anticlines or antisynclines.


Syncline and Anticline (antisyncline)
Formation (Formation of Himalayas explained in C-C Convergence)
• Shiwaliks were formed last of all the ranges (2-20 million years ago).

19


• The Shiwaliks are consolidated sands, gravels and conglomerate deposits (alluvial fans – fluvial depositional
landform) which were brought by the rivers flowing from the higher ranges.

• These deposits were folded and hardened due to compression offered by the northward movement of the
Indian plate.

The Shiwaliks are known by different names in different areas

Nepal
Explain the formation of Duns (Duras)
• Shiwalik Hills were formed by the accumulation of conglomerates (sand, stone, silt, gravel, debris etc.).

• These conglomerates, in the initial stages of deposition, obstructed the courses of the rivers draining from
the higher reaches of the Himalayas and formed temporary lakes.

• With the passage of time, these temporary lakes accumulated more and more conglomerates. The con-
glomerates were well settled at the bottom of the lakes.

• When the rivers were able to cut their courses through the lakes filled with conglomerate deposits, the
lakes were drained away leaving behind plains called ‘duns’ or ‘doons’ in the west and ‘duars’ in the east.

• Dehra Dun in Uttarakhand is the best example (75 km long and 15-20 km wide)
• Kotah, Patli Kothri, Chumbi, Kyarda, Chaukhamba, Udhampur and Kotli are other important duns.

3.3 The Lesser Himalayas or The Middle Himalayas or The Himachal
• In between the Shiwaliks in the south and the Greater Himalayas in the north.

• Runs almost parallel to both the ranges.

• They are also called the Lower Himalaya.

• The Lower Himalayan ranges are 60-80 km wide and about 2400 km in length.

• Elevations vary from 3,500 to 4,500 m above sea level.

• Many peaks are more than 5,050 m above sea level and are snow-covered throughout the year.

• The Lower Himalayas have steep, bare southern slopes (steep slopes prevent soil formation) and gen-
tler, forest covered northern slopes.

20


• In Uttarakhand, the Middle Himalayas are marked by the Mussoorie and the Nag Tibba ranges.

• The Mahabharat Lekh, in southern Nepal, is a continuation of the Mussoorie Range.

• East of the Kosi River, the Sapta Kosi, Sikkim, Bhutan, Miri, Abor and Mishmi hills represent the lower
Himalayas.

• The Middle Himalayan ranges are more friendly to human contact.

Majority of the Himalayan hill resorts like Shimla, Mussoorie, Ranikhet, Nainital, Almora and Darjeeling,
etc. are located here.

The Pir Panjal range
• The Pir Panjal range in Kashmir is the longest and the most important range.

• It extends from the Jhelum river to the upper Beas river for over 300 km.

• It rises to 5,000 metres and contains mostly volcanic rocks.

Passes in Pir Panjal
• Pir Panjal Pass (3,480 m), the Bidil (4,270 m), Golabghar Pass (3,812 m) and Banihal Pass (2,835 m).

• The Banihal Pass was used by the Jammu-Srinagar highway and Jammu-Baramulla railway.

• The Kishanganga, the Jhelum and the Chenab cut through the range.

• Southeast of the Ravi, the Pir Panjal continues as Dhaola Dhar range, passing through Dalhousie,
Dharamshala, and Shimla.

Important Valleys
• Between the Pir Panjal and the Zaskar Range of the main Himalayas, lies the valley of Kashmir (average
elevation is 1,585 m above mean sea level).

21


• The synclinal basin of the valley is floored with alluvial, lacustrine (lake deposits), fluvial (river action) and
glacial deposits.

• Jehlum River meanders through these deposits and cuts a deep gorge in Pir Panjal through which it drains.

(Kashmir is a basin with very few outlets. Hence the region is extremely vulnerable to flooding).

• In Himachal Pradesh, there is Kangra Valley. It is a strike valley and extends from the foot of the Dhaola
Dhar Range to the south of Beas.

• On the other hand, the Kulu Valley in the upper course of the Ravi is a transverse valley.

Strike valley vs. Transverse valley
• A valley perpendicular to the slope or parallel to the ridge (also called as a longitudinal valley)
• In contrast, transverse streams cut valleys parallel to the slope (along the dip).


Strike valley vs. Transverse valley
3.4 The Greater Himalaya
• Also known as Inner Himalaya, Central Himalaya or Himadri.

• Average elevation of 6,100 m above sea level and an average width of about 25 km.

• It is mainly formed of the central crystallines (granites and gneisses) overlain by metamorphosed sedi-
ments (limestone).

• The folds in this range are asymmetrical with steep south slope and gentle north slope giving hogback (a
long, steep hill or mountain ridge) topography.

• This mountain arc convexes to the south just like the other two.

• The Himadri terminates abruptly at the syntaxial bends.

22


• One in the Nanga Parbat in the north-west and the other in the Namcha Barwa in the north-east.

Syntaxial Bends of the Himalayas
• The Himalayas extend in the east-west direction from the Indus gorge in the west to the Brahmaputra
gorge in the east.

• Himalayan ranges take sharp southward bends at these gorges. These bends are called syntaxial bends of
the Himalayas.

• The western syntaxial bend occurs near the Naga Parbat (western tip of The Zaskar Range) where the
Indus river has cut a deep gorge.

• The eastern syntaxial bend occurs near the Namche Barwa.

Nanga Parbat means Naked Mountain. It is called so due to its isolation from the Karakoram range that
has many similar high peaks (eight-thousanders)
• This mountain range boasts of the tallest peaks of the world, most of which remain under perpetual snow.

3.5 The Trans Himalayas
• The Trans Himalayas are the Himalayan ranges immediately north of the Great Himalayan range.

• Also called the Tibetan Himalaya because most of it lies in Tibet.

• The average elevation is 3000 m above mean sea level.

• The average width of this region is 40 km at the extremities and about 225 km in the central part.

• It stretches for a distance of about 1,000 km in the east-west direction (occur only in the western part of
the Himalayas).

Ranges in The Trans Himalayas
• The Zanskar, the Ladakh, the Kailas and the Karakoram are the main ranges.

• The Nanga Parbat (8126 m) is in The Zaskar Range.

• North of the Zaskar Range and running parallel to it is the Ladakh Range.

• Only a few peaks of this range attain heights of over 6000 metres.

• The Kailas Range (Gangdise in Chinese) in western Tibet is an offshoot of the Ladakh Range.

• The highest peak is Mount Kailas (6714 m).

• River Indus originates from the northern slopes of the Kailas range.

• The northernmost range of the Trans-Himalayan Ranges in India is the Karakoram Range also known as
the Krishnagiri range.

• Karakoram Range extends eastwards from the Pamir for about 800 km.

• It is a range with lofty peaks (elevation 5,500 m and above). It is the abode of some of the greatest glaci-
ers of the world outside the polar regions.

• Some of the peaks are more than 8,000 meters above sea level. K2 (8,611 m) (Godwin Austen or Qogir in
Karakoram Range) is the second highest peak in the world and the highest peak in the Indian Union.

• The Ladakh Plateau lies to the north-east of the Karakoram Range. It has been dissected into a number of
plains and mountains (Soda Plains, Aksai Chin, Lingzi Tang, Depsang Plains and Chang Chenmo)
3.6 Purvanchal or Eastern Hills
24


• Eastern Hills or The Purvanchals are the southward extensions of the Himalayas running along the north-
eastern edge of India.

• At the Dihang gorge, the Himalayas take a sudden southward bend and form a series of comparatively low
hills which are collectively called as the Purvanchal.

• Purvanchal hills are convex to the west.

• They run along the India-Myanmar Border extending from Arunachal Pradesh in the north to Mizoram in
the south.

25


Purvanchal Hills
• Patkai Bum hills are made up of strong sandstone; elevation varys from 2,000 m to 3,000 m; merges into
Naga Hills where Saramati (3,826 m) is the highest peak.

• Patkai Bum and Naga Hills form the watershed between India and Myanmar.

26


• South of Naga Hills are the Manipur hills which are generally less than 2,500 metres in elevation.

• The Barail range separates Naga Hills from Manipur Hills.

• Further south the Barail Range swings to the west into Jaintia, Khasi and Garo hills which are an eastward
continuation of the Indian peninsular block.

• They are separated from the main block by Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers.

• South of the Manipur Hills are the Mizo Hills (previously known as the Lushai hills) which have an elevation
of less than 1,500 metres. The highest point is the Blue Mountain (2,157 m) in the south.

3.7 Himalayas – Regional Divisions
27


Himalayan Ranges and Hills
Punjab Himalayas
• The Himalayan region between the Indus and the Satluj rivers (560 km long).

• All the major rivers of the Indus river system flow through Punjab Himalayas.

28


• A large portion of Punjab Himalayas is in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Hence, they are also
called the Kashmir and Himachal Himalaya.

• Karakoram, Ladakh, Pir Panjal, Zaskar and Dhaola Dhar are the major ranges in this section.

• The general elevation falls westwards.

Western Himalayas
• Between the Indus in the west and the Kali river in the east (880 km).

• Spread across three states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

• It encompasses three physiographic provinces namely Kashmir Himalaya, Himachal Himalaya and Ku-
maon Himalaya (Uttarakhand Himalayas).

• The Ladakh plateau and the Kashmir valley are two important areas of the Kashmir Himalayan region.

29


• In Himachal Himalayas, The Greater Himalaya is represented by the Zaskar range, lesser Himalaya by Pir
Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges and the Outer Himalaya by the Shiwalik range.

• The southern slopes are rugged, steep and forested while the northern slopes are bare and gentle.

• The Kumaon Himalayas lie in Uttarakhand and extend from the Satluj to the Kali river.

• The Lesser Himalayas in Kumaon Himalaya is represented by the Mussoorie and Nag Tiba ranges.

• The Shiwalik in this region runs south of the Mussoorie range between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers.

• The flat valleys between the Lesser Himalaya and the Shiwalik range are called ‘doons’ or ‘Duns’ of
which Dehra Dun is the most famous.

Central Himalayas
• 800 km between river Kali in the west and river Tista in the east.

• The Great Himalaya range attains maximum height in this portion.

• Some of the world famous peaks Mt. Everest, Kanchenjunga, Makalu, Annapurna, Gosainthan and
Dhaulagiri, are located here.

• The Lesser Himalaya is known as Mahabharat Lekh in this region.

• The range is crossed by rivers like Ghaghara, Gandak, Kosi, etc.

• In between the Great and the Lesser Himalayas, there are Kathmandu and Pokhra lacustrine valleys (pre-
viously, they were lakes).

• The Shiwalik range comes very close to the lesser Himalaya towards the east and is almost non-existent be-
yond Narayani (Gandak).

Eastern Himalayas
• Also known as the Assam Himalayas, this part of the Himalayas lies between the Tista river in the west and
the Brahmaputra river in the east and stretches for a distance of about 720 km.

• Elevation here is much lesser than that of the Nepal Himalayas.

• The southern slopes are very steep, but the northern slopes are gentle.

• The Lesser Himalayas are very narrow and are very close to the Greater Himalayas.

• The Assam Himalayas show a marked dominance of fluvial erosion due to heavy rainfall.

• The Himalayas take a sudden southward turn after the Dihang gorge and the hill ranges running in a more
or less north-south direction along India's border with Myanmar are collectively known as the Purvanchal.

• Purvanchal hills are known by various local names such as Patkai Bum, Naga Hills, Kohima hills, Ma-
nipur hills, Mizo hills (previously known as the Lushai hills), Tripura hills and Barail range.

30


• The extension of the Purvanchal Himalaya continues southwards up to Andaman and Nicobar Islands
through the Myanmar range (Arakan Yoma) and even up to the Indonesian archipelago.

In the eastern section, the Himalayas rise abruptly from the plains of Bengal and Oudh and suddenly attain great
elevations within a short distance. Thus, the peaks of Kanchenjunga and Everest are only a few kilometres from
the plains.

In contrast, the western Himalayas rise gradually from the plains through a series of ranges. Their peaks of per-
petual snow are 150 to 200 km away from the plain areas.

3.8 Important Valleys in the Himalayas
The most important valleys in the Himalayan region are
1) the valley of Kashmir and the Karewas,
2) the Kangra and Kulu valley in Himachal Pradesh;
3) the Dun valley (Doon valley, Dehradun valley); the Bhagirathi valley (near Gangotri) and the Manda-
kini valley (near Kedarnath) in Uttarakhand and
4) the Kathmandu valley in Nepal.

Karewas
• Karewas are lacustrine deposits (deposits in the lake) in the Valley of Kashmir and Bhadarwah Valley of the
Jammu Division.

• These are the flat-topped mounds that border the Kashmir Valley on all sides.

• They are characterised with fossils of mammals and at places by peat.

Formation
• During the Pleistocene Period (1 million years ago), the entire Valley of Kashmir was under water.

• Subsequently, due to endogenic forces, the Baramullah Gorge was created, and the lake was drained
through this gorge.

• The deposits left in the process are known as karewas.

• The thickness of karewas is about 1400 m.

• The karewas have been elevated, dissected and removed by denudation as well as by the Jhelum river giv-
ing them the present position.

31


Economic Significance
• The karewas are mainly devoted to the cultivation of saffron, almond, walnut, apple and orchards.

3.9 Snow in the Himalayas – Snowline
• The snow line (the lowest level of perpetual snow) varies in different parts of the Himalayas depending up-
on latitude, amount of precipitation and local topography.

• In Eastern Himalayas and Kumaon Himalayas, the snowline is around 3,500 m above sea level where-
as in the western Himalayas snowline is about 2,500 m above sea level.

• This difference in snowline is partly due to the increase in latitude from 28° N in Kanchenjunga to 36° N in
the Karakoram.

• But the major factor is precipitation. Precipitation in the western Himalayas is comparatively low and oc-
curs mostly as snowfall whereas in the eastern Himalayas the precipitation is greater and occurs mostly in
the form of rain.

• In the Great Himalayan ranges, the snow line is at a lower elevation on the southern slopes than on the
northern slopes because the southern slopes receive more precipitation as compared to the northern
slopes.

3.10 Glaciers in the Himalayas
• There are about 15,000 glaciers in the Himalayas.

• The total area of Himalayas is about five lakh square kilometres (area of India is nearly 32 lakh square km).

About 33,000 square km area is covered by snow.

Glaciers of the Karakoram Range
• Maximum development of glaciers occurs in the Karakoram range.

• Some of the largest glaciers outside the polar and sub-polar regions are found in this range.

• The southern side of this range has many gigantic glaciers.

• The 75 km long Siachen Glacier in Nubra valley has the distinction of being the largest glacier outside
the polar and the sub-polar regions.

• The second largest is the 74 km long Fedchenko Glacier (Pamirs).

• Third largest is the Hispar Glacier. It is 62 km long and occupies a tributary of the Hunza River.

Glaciers of the Pir Panjal Range
32


• The glaciers of the Pir Panjal Range are less numerous and smaller in size as compared to those of the Ka-
rakoram Range.

• The longest Sonapani Glacier in the Chandra Valley of Lahul and Spiti region is only 15 km long.

Others
• Glaciers of the Kumaon-Garhwal Region: In the Kumaon-Garhwal region of the Himalayas, the largest is the
30 km long Gangotri Glacier which is the source of the river Ganga.

Garhwal Region
• Lying in the Himalayas, it is bounded on the north by Tibet, on the east by Kumaon region, on
the south by Uttar Pradesh state, and on the northwest by Himachal Pradesh state.

• It includes the districts of Chamoli, Dehradun, Haridwar, Pauri Garhwal, Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal,
and Uttarkashi.


Garhwal Region
• Glaciers of Central Nepal: Zemu and the Kanchenjunga glaciers are the major ones.

3.11 The significance of the Himalayas
Influence on Indian Climate
• They intercept the summer monsoons coming from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea causing pre-
cipitation in the entire Ganga Plains, North-Eastern Hills.

33


• They direct the monsoon winds towards north-western India (Punjab, Haryana etc. But these regions re-
ceive most of the rainfall due to Western Disturbances coming from the Mediterranean regions).

• They protect northern-plains from the cold continental air masses of central Asia.

• The Himalayas influence the path of Sub-tropical Jet stream flowing in the region. They split the jet stream,
and this split jet stream plays an important role in bringing monsoons to India.

• Had there been no Himalayas, the whole of India would have been a desert and its winters would have
been very severe.

Source of Rivers
• Rivers that feed nearly half a billion population of India originate in the Himalayas.

• All the rivers are perennial supplying water year round.

Fertile Soil
• The swift flowing rivers from the Himalayas bring an enormous amount of silt (alluvium) which continually
enrich the Ganga and Brahmaputra plains.

Hydroelectricity
• Due to its natural topography and swift flowing perennial rivers, the Himalayan region offers several natural
sites with great hydroelectric power generation potential.

• Many hydroelectric power plants have already been constructed.

• But all this comes at a tremendous environmental cost.

Forest Wealth
• The Himalayan host rich coniferous and evergreen forests.

• Lower levels have tropical evergreen forests, and higher levels have Alpine vegetation (Coniferous).

• The Himalayan forests provide fuelwood and a large variety of timber for industries.

• Himalayan forests host a wide variety of medicinal plants.

• Several patches are covered with grass offering rich pastures for grazing animals.

Agriculture
• Due to rugged and sloped terrain, the Himalayas are not potential agricultural sites.

• Some slopes are terraced for cultivation. Rice is the main crop on the terraced slopes.

34


• The other crops are wheat, maize, potatoes, etc.

• Tea is a unique crop which can be grown only on the Shiwalik hill slopes in the region.

• Fruit cultivation is a principal occupation. A wide variety of fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, mulberry,
walnut, cherries, peaches, apricot, etc. are also grown in the Himalayan region.

Tourism
• Himalayan ranges have a large number of tourist spots.

• The hilly areas in the Himalayas are not affected by hot winds like the loo. Hence, they offer cool and com-
fortable climate.

• The increasing popularity of winter sports has increased the rush of tourists in winters.

• Srinagar, Dalhousie, Dharamshala, Chamba, Shimla, Kulu, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, Ranikhet, Al-
mora, Darjeeling, Mirik, Gangtok, etc. are important tourist centres in the Himalayas.

Cultural Tourism
• Himalayas host many Hindu and Buddhist shrines.

• Kailas, Amarnath, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Vaishnu Devi, Jwalaji, Uttarkashi, Gangotri, Yamunotri, etc.

are important places of pilgrimage.

Defense
• The Himalayas are a natural defense barrier.

• But the Chinese aggression on India in 1962 has reduced the defence significance of the Himalayas.

Mineral Resources in the Himalayas
• Geosynclinal (geosynclinical) deposits in tertiary rocks are regions of potential coal (peat) and oil reserves.

• Coal is found in Kashmir, Copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, limestone, semi-precious and precious stones oc-
cur at some places in the Himalayas.

• But the exploitation of these resources requires advanced technologies which are not yet available.

Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plains
4.1 The formation of Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain
• The formation of the Indo-Gangetic plain is closely related to the formation of Himalayas.

43


Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra trough
• The rivers which were previously flowing into Tethys sea (before Indian Plate collided with Eurasian) depos-
ited a huge amount of sediments in the Tethys Geosyncline (a huge depression).

• The Himalayas are formed out of these sediments which were uplifted, folded and compressed due to
northern movement of Indian Plate.

• Northern movement of the Indian Plate also created a trough to the south of Himalayas.

Depositional Activity
• During the initial stages of upliftment of sediments, the already existing rivers changed their course several
times and they were rejuvenated each time (perpetual youth stage of rivers).

• The rejuvenation is associated with intense headward and vertical downcutting of the soft strata overlying
the harder rock stratum.

• Headward erosion and vertical erosion of the river valley in the initial stages, lateral erosion in later stages
contributed a huge amount of conglomerates (rock debris, silt, clay etc.) which were carried downslope.

Headward erosion: Erosion at the origin of a stream channel, which causes the origin to move back away from
the direction of the stream flow, and so causes the stream channel to lengthen.

• These conglomerates were deposited in the depression (Indo-Gangetic Trough or Indo-Gangetic syn-
cline) (the base of the geosyncline is hard crystalline rock) between peninsular India and the conver-
gent boundary (the region of present-day Himalayas).

New rivers and more alluvium
• The raising of the Himalayas and the subsequent formation of glaciers gave rise to many new rivers.

• These rivers along with glacial erosion supplied more alluvium which intensified the filling of the depres-
sion.

• With the accumulation of more and more sediments (conglomerates), the Tethys sea started receding.

• With the passage of the time, the depression was completely filled with alluvium, gravel, rock debris (con-
glomerates) and the Tethys completely disappeared leaving behind a monotonous aggradational plain.

Monotonous: featureless topography; Aggradational plain: plain formed due to depositional activity.

• Upper peninsular rivers have also contributed to the formation of plains, but to a very small extent.

44


• During recent times (since a few million years), depositional work of three major river systems viz., the In-
dus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra have become predominant.

• Hence this arcuate (curved) plain is also known as Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain.


Elevation of the major physiographic divisions of India
4.2 Features of Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain
• Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain is the largest alluvial tract of the world.

• It stretches for about 3,200 km from the mouth of the Indus to the mouth of the Ganga.

• Indian sector of the plain accounts for 2,400 km.

• The northern boundary is well marked by the Shiwaliks and the southern boundary is a wavy irregular line
along the northern edge of Peninsular India.

• The western border is marked by Sulaiman and Kirthar ranges.

• On the eastern side, the plains are bordered by Purvanchal hills.

• It is widest in the west where it stretches for about 500 km. Its width decreases in the east.

• The thickness of the alluvium deposits also varies from place to place. The maximum depth of the alluvium
up to the basement rocks is about 6,100 m (not uniform and varies greatly from place to place).

• Extreme horizontality of this monotonous plain is its chief characteristic.

• Its average elevation is about 200 m above mean sea level, highest elevation being 291 m above mean sea
level near Ambala (This elevation forms the drainage divide or watershed between Indus system and
Ganga system).

• Its average gradient from Saharanpur to Kolkata is only 20 cm per km and it decreases to 15 cm per km
from Varanasi to the Ganga delta.

45


Divisions of Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain
• Geologically, the alluvium of the Great plain of India is divided into newer or younger khadar and older
bhangar soils.

The Bhabar
• It is a narrow, porous, northernmost stretch of Indo-Gangetic plain.

• It is about 8-16 km wide running in an east-west direction along the foothills (alluvial fans) of the Shiwa-
liks.

• They show a remarkable continuity from the Indus to the Tista.

• Rivers descending from the Himalayas deposit their load along the foothills in the form of alluvial fans.

• These alluvial fans (often pebbly soils) have merged together to build up the bhabar belt.

• The porosity of bhabar is the most unique feature.

• The porosity is due to deposition of huge number of pebbles and rock debris across the alluvial fans.

• The streams disappear once they reach the bhabar region because of this porosity.

• Therefore, the area is marked by dry river courses except in the rainy season.

• The Bhabar belt is comparatively narrow in the east and extensive in the west.

The area is not suitable for agriculture, and only big trees with large roots thrive in this belt.

The Terai
• Terai is an ill-drained, damp (marshy) and thickly forested narrow tract to the south of Bhabar running
parallel to it.

• The Terai is about15-30 km wide.

• The underground streams of the Bhabar belt re-emerge in this belt.

This thickly forested region provides shelter to a variety of wildlife. (Jim Corbett National Park in Utta-
rakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam lie in terai region)
46


The Terai Marshes
• The Terai is more marked in the eastern part than in the west because the eastern parts receive a
comparatively higher amount of rainfall.

• The terai soils are silty and rich in nitrogen and organic matter but are deficient in phosphate.

• Most of the Terai land, especially in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, has been turned into agricul-
tural land which gives good crops of sugarcane, rice and wheat.

The Bhangar
• The Bhangar is the older alluvium along the river beds forming terraces higher than the flood plain.

• The terraces are often impregnated with calcareous concretions (beds of lime nodules) known as ‘Kankar’.

• ‘The Barind plains’ in the deltaic region of Bengal and the ‘bhur formations’ in the middle Ganga and
Yamuna doab are regional variations of Bhangar.

Bhur denotes an elevated piece of land situated along the banks of the Ganga river especially in the upper Gan-
ga-Yamuna Doab.

This has been formed due to the accumulation of wind-blown sands during the hot, dry months of the year.

• Bhangar contains fossils of animals like rhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephants, etc.

• The soil is of a more clayey composition and is generally dark coloured.

The Khadar
• The Khadar is composed of newer alluvium and forms the flood plains along the river banks.

• A new layer of alluvium is deposited by river flood almost every year.

• This makes them the most fertile soils of Ganges.

• They are sandy clays and loams, drier and more leached and less calcareous.

47


Reh or Kollar
• Reh or Kollar comprises saline efflorescences of drier areas in Haryana.

• Reh areas have spread in recent times with increase in irrigation (capillary action brings salts to the surface).

Regional Divisions of the Great Plains
1. Sindh Plain
2. Rajasthan Plain.

3. Punjab Plain.

4. Ganga Plain.

5. Brahmaputra Plain.

6. Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta
Sindh Plain (Pakistan)
• Mainly formed of Bhangar Plains.

• Dhors: Long narrow depressions which are the remnants of the course of former rivers.

• Dhand: Alkaline lakes on some dhors.

Rajasthan Plain
• Occupied by Thar or the Great Indian Desert.

• This plain is an undulating plain (wave-like) whose average elevation is about 325 m.

• The desert region is called Marusthali and forms a greater part of the Marwar plain.

• It has a few outcrops of gneisses, schists and granites which proves that geologically it is a part of the Pen-
insular Plateau. It is only at the surface that it looks like an aggradational plain.

• In general, the eastern part of the Marusthali is rocky while its western part is covered by shifting sand
dunes locally known as dhrian.

• The eastern part of the Thar Desert up to the Aravalli Range is a semi-arid plain known as Rajasthan Bagar.

• It is drained by a number of short seasonal streams originating from the Aravallis and supports agriculture
in some patches of fertile tracts.

• Luni is an important seasonal stream which flows into Rann of Kutch. The tract north of the Luni is known
as thali or sandy plain.

Saline Lakes
48


• North of the Luni, there is inland drainage having several saline lakes. They are a source of common salt
and many other salts.

• Sambhar, Didwana, Degana, Kuchaman, etc. are some of the important lakes. The largest is the Sambhar
lake near Jaipur.

Punjab Plain
• This plain is formed by five important rivers of the Indus system.

• The plain is primarily made up of ‘doabs’ — the land between two rivers.

• The depositional process by the rivers has united these doabs giving a homogenous appearance.

• Punjab literally means "(The Land of) Five Waters" referring to the following rivers: the Jhe-
lum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas.

• The average elevation of the plain is about 250 m above mean sea level.

• The eastern boundary of Punjab Haryana plain is marked by subsurface Delhi-Aravali ridge.

• The northern part of this plain (Shiwalik hills) has been intensively eroded by numerous streams called
Chos. This has led to enormous gullying.

• To the south of the Satluj river, there is Malwa plain of Punjab.

• The area between the Ghaggar and the Yamuna rivers lies in Haryana and often termed as ‘Haryana Tract’.

It acts as water-divide between the Yamuna and the Satluj rivers.

The only river between the Yamuna and the Satluj is the Ghaggar which is considered to be the present
day successor of the legendary Saraswati River.

Ganga Plain
• This is the largest unit of the Great Plain of India stretching from Delhi to Kolkata (about 3.75 lakh sq km).

• The Ganga along with its large number of tributaries originating in the Himalayans have brought large
quantities of alluvium from the mountains and deposited it here to build this extensive plain.

• The peninsular rivers such as Chambal, Betwa, Ken, Son, etc. joining the Ganga river system have also con-
tributed to the formation of this plain.

• Rivers flow sluggishly in the lower sections of Ganges as a result of which the area is marked by local prom-
inences such as levees, bluffs, oxbow lakes, marshes, ravines, etc.

• Almost all the rivers keep on shifting their courses making this area prone to frequent floods.

• The Kosi river is very notorious in this respect. It has long been called the ‘Sorrow of Bihar’.

49


Regional divisions of Ganga plains
• Rohilkhand plains
• Avadh Plains
• Mithila Plain
• Magadh Plain.

Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta
• This is the largest delta in the world.

• The slope of the land here is a mere 2 cm per km. Two-thirds of the area are below 30 m above mean sea
level (Highly vulnerable to sea level changes).

• The seaward face of the delta is studded with a large number of estuaries, mudflats, mangrove swamps,
sandbanks, islands and forelands.

• A large part of the coastal delta is covered by tidal forests. These are called the Sundarbans because of
the predominance of Sundari trees here.

Brahmaputra Plain
• This is also known as the Brahmaputra valley or Assam Valley or Assam Plain as most of the Brahmaputra
valley is situated in Assam.

• Its western boundary is formed by the Indo-Bangladesh border as well as the boundary of the lower Ganga
Plain. Its eastern boundary is formed by Purvanchal hills.

• It is an aggradational plain built up by the depositional work of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries.

• The innumerable tributaries of the Brahmaputra river coming from the north form a number of alluvial fans.

• Consequently, the tributaries branch out in many channels giving birth to river meandering leading to the
formation of bill and ox-bow lakes.

• There are large marshy tracts in this area. The alluvial fans formed by the coarse alluvial debris have led to
the formation of terai or semi-terai conditions.

The significance of the Plain
• This one-fourth of the land of the country hosts half of the Indian population.

• Fertile alluvial soils, flat surface, slow-moving perennial rivers and favourable climate facilitate the intense
agricultural activity.

50


• The extensive use of irrigation has made Punjab, Haryana and western part of Uttar Pradesh the granary of
India (Prairies are called the granaries of the world).

• The entire plain except the Thar Desert has a close network of roads and railways which has led to large
scale industrialisation and urbanisation.

• Cultural tourism: There are many religious places along the banks of the sacred rivers like the Ganga and
the Yamuna which are very dear to Hindus.

• Here flourished the religions of Buddha and Mahavira and the movements of Bhakti and Sufism.

5. Peninsular Plateau
• Peninsular Plateau is an aggregation of several smaller plateaus and hill ranges.

• The Peninsular Plateau is one of the oldest landforms of the earth.

• It is a highly stable block composed mostly of the Archaean gneisses and schists.

• Since a few hundred million years, it has never been submerged beneath the sea except in a few places.

• It covers a total area of about 16 lakh square km.

• The average height of the plateau is 600-900 m above sea level (varies from region to region).

• Most of the peninsular rivers flow west to east indicating its general slope.

• Narmada-Tapti are the exceptions which flow from east to west in a rift.

5.1 Minor Plateaus in the Peninsular Plateau
51


Minor Plateaus in the Peninsular Plateau
Marwar Plateau or Mewar Plateau
52


• It is the plateau of eastern Rajasthan (Marwar plain is to the west of Aravallis whereas Marwar plateau is to
the east).

• The average elevation is 250-500 m above sea level, and it slopes down eastwards.

• It is made up of sandstone, shales and limestones of the Vindhyan period.

• The Banas river, along with its tributaries (Berach river, Khari rivers) originate in the Aravalli Range and
flow towards northwest into Chambal river.

• The erosional activity of these rives makes the plateau top appear like a rolling plain.

Rolling Plain: ‘Rolling plains’ are not completely flat: there are slight rises and fall in the landform. Ex: Prairies of
USA
Central Highland
• Also called the Madhya Bharat Pathar or Madhya Bharat Plateau.

• It is to the east of the Marwar or Mewar Upland.

• Most of the plateau comprises the basin of the Chambal river which flows in a rift valley.

• The Kali Sindh, flowing from Rana Pratap Sagar, The Banas flowing through Mewar plateau and The Par-
wan and the Parbati flowing from Madhya Pradesh are its main tributaries.

• It is a rolling plateau with rounded hills composed of sandstone. Thick forests grow here.

• To the north are the ravines or badlands of the Chambal river (they are typical to Chambal river basin).

Bundelkhand Upland
• Yamuna river to the north, Madhya Bharat Pathar to the west, Vindhyan Scarplands to the east and south-
east and Malwa Plateau to the south.

• It is the old dissected (divided by a number of deep valleys) upland of the ‘Bundelkhand gneiss’ comprising
of granite and gneiss.

• Spreads over five districts of Uttar Pradesh and four districts of Madhya Pradesh.

• The average elevation of 300-600 m above sea level, this area slopes down from the Vindhyan Scarp toward
the Yamuna River.

• The erosional work of the rivers flowing here have converted it into an undulating (wave-like surface) area
and rendered it unfit for cultivation.

• The region is characterised by senile (characteristic of or caused by old age) topography.

• Streams like Betwa, Dhasan and Ken flow through the plateau.

53


Malwa Plateau
• The Malwa Plateau roughly forms a triangle based on the Vindhyan Hills, bounded by the Aravalli Range in
the west and Madhya Bharat Pathar to the north and Bundelkhand to the east.

• This plateau has two systems of drainage; one towards the Arabian sea (The Narmada, the Tapti and the
Mahi), and the other towards the Bay of Bengal (Chambal and Betwa, joining the Yamuna).

• In the north, it is drained by the Chambal and many of its right bank tributaries like the Kali, the Sindh and
the Parbati. It also includes the upper courses of the Sindh, the Ken and the Betwa.

• It is composed of extensive lava flow and is covered with black soils.

• The general slope is towards the north (decreases from 600 m in the south to less than 500 m in the north).

• This is a rolling plateau dissected by rivers. In the north, the plateau is marked by the Chambal ravines.

Baghelkhand
• North of the Maikal Range is the Baghelkhand.

• Made of limestones and sandstones on the west and granite in the east.

• It is bounded by the Son river on the north.

• The central part of the plateau acts as a water divide between the Son drainage system in the north and the
Mahanadi river system in the south.

• The region is uneven with general elevation varying from 150 m to 1,200 m.

Chotanagpur Plateau
• Chotanagpur plateau represents the north-eastern projection of the Indian Peninsula.

• Mostly in Jharkhand, the northern part of Chhattisgarh and Purulia district of West Bengal.

• The Son River flows in the north-west of the plateau and joins the Ganga.

• The average elevation of the plateau is 700 m above sea level.

• This plateau is composed mainly of Gondwana rocks.

• The plateau is drained by numerous rivers and streams in different directions and presents a radial drain-
age pattern.

• Rivers like the Damodar, the Subarnrekaha, the North Koel, the South Koel and the Barkar have devel-
oped extensive drainage basins.

• The Damodar river flows through the middle of this region in a rift valley from west to east. Gondwana
coal fields which provide the bulk of coal in India are situated here.

54


• North of the Damodar river is the Hazaribagh plateau with an average elevation of 600 m above mean sea
level. This plateau has isolated hills. It looks like a peneplain due to large scale erosion.

• The Ranchi Plateau to the south of the Damodar Valley rises to about 600 m above mean sea level. Most
of the surface is rolling where the city of Ranchi (661 m) is located.

• At places, it is interrupted by monadnocks (an isolated hill or ridge of erosion-resistant rock rising above a
peneplain. Ex: Ayers Rock in Australia) and conical hills.

• The Rajmahal Hills forming the northeastern edge of the Chotanagpur Plateau are mostly made of basalt
and are covered by lava flows.

• They run in a north-south direction and rise to an average elevation of 400 m (highest mount is 567 m).

• These hills have been dissected into separate plateaus.

Meghalaya Plateau
• The peninsular plateau extends further east beyond the Rajmahal hills to from Meghalaya or the Shillong
plateau. The eastward extinction is known as Karbi Anglong plateau.

• Garo-Rajmahal Gap separates this plateau from the main block.

• This gap was formed by down-faulting (normal fault: a block of earth slides downwards).

• It was later filled by sediments deposited by the Ganga and Brahmaputra.

• Its western boundary more or less coincides with the Bangladesh border.

• The western, central and the eastern parts of the plateau are known as the Garo Hills (900 m), the Khasi-
Jaintia Hills (1,500 m) and the Mikir Hills (700 m).

• Shillong (1,961 m) is the highest point of the plateau.

Deccan Plateau
• It covers an area of about five lakh square km.

• It is triangular in shape and is bounded by the Satpura and the Vindhya in the north-west, the Mahadev
and the Maikal in the north, the Western Ghats in the west and the Eastern Ghats in the east.

• Its average elevation is 600 m.

• It rises to 1000 m in the south but dips to 500 m in the north.

• Its general slope is from west to east which is indicated by the flow of its major rivers.

• Rivers have further subdivided this plateau into a number of smaller plateaus.

Maharashtra Plateau
55


• The Maharashtra Plateau lies in Maharashtra.

• It forms the northern part of the Deccan Plateau.

• Much of the region is underlain by basaltic rocks of lava origin (Most of the Deccan Traps lies in this re-
gion).

• The area looks like a rolling plain due to weathering.

• The horizontal lava sheets have led to the formation of typical Deccan Trap topography (step-like).


Step like appearance of Deccan Traps
• The broad and shallow valleys of the Godavari, the Bhima and the Krishna are flanked (bordered on the op-
posite sides) by flat-topped steep-sided hills and ridges.

• The entire area is covered by black cotton soil known as regur.

Karnataka Plateau
• The Karnataka Plateau is also known as the Mysore plateau.

• Lies to the south of the Maharashtra plateau.

• The area looks like a rolling plateau with an average elevation of 600-900 m.

• It is highly dissected by numerous rivers rising from the Western Ghats.

• The general trend of the hills is either parallel to the Western Ghats or across it.

• The highest peak (1913 m) is at Mulangiri in Baba Budan Hills in Chikmagalur district.

• The plateau is divided into two parts called Malnad and Maidan.

• The Malnad in Kannada means hill country. It is dissected into deep valleys covered with dense forests.

• The Maidan, on the other hand, is formed of rolling plain with low granite hills.

56


• The plateau tapers between the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats in the south and merges with the
Nilgiri hills there.

Telangana plateau
• Its average elevation is 500-600 m.

• The southern part is higher than its northern counterpart.

• The region is drained by three river systems, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Penneru.

• The entire plateau is divided into Ghats and the Peneplains (a vast featureless, undulating plain which the
last stage of the deposition process).

Chhattisgarh Plain
• The Chhattisgarh plain is the only plain worth the name in the Peninsular plateau.

• It is a saucer-shaped depression drained by the upper Mahanadi.

• The whole basin lies between the Maikal Range and the Odisha hills.

• The region was once ruled by Haithaivanshi Rajputs from whose thirty-six forts (Chhattisgarh) it derives its
name.

• The general elevation of the plain ranges from 250 m in the east to 330 m in the west.

5.2 Hill Ranges of the Peninsular Plateau
• Most of the hills in the peninsular region are of the relict type (residual hills).

• They are the remnants of the hills and horsts formed many million years ago (horst: uplifted block; graben:
subsided block).

• The plateaus of the Peninsular region are separated from one another by these hill ranges and various river
valleys.

57


Major Hill Ranges of the Peninsular Plateau
Aravalli Range
• They are aligned in north-east to south-west direction.

• They run for about 800 km between Delhi and Palanpur in Gujarat.

58


• They are one of the oldest (very old) fold mountains of the world and the oldest in India.

• After its formation, its summits were nourishing glaciers, and several summits were probably higher than
the present-day Himalayas.

• Now they are relict (remnants after severe weathering and erosion since millions of years) of the world's
oldest mountain formed as a result of folding.

• They continue up to Haridwar buried under the alluvium of Ganga Plains.

• The range is conspicuous in Rajasthan (continuous range south of Ajmer where it rises to 900 m.) but be-
comes less distinct in Haryana and Delhi (characterised by a chain of detached and discontinuous ridges
beyond Ajmer).

• According to some geographers, one Branch of the Aravallis extends to the Lakshadweep Archipelago
through the Gulf of Khambhat and the other into Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

• Its general elevation is only 400-600 m, with few hills well above 1,000 m.

• At the south-west extremity, the range rises to over 1,000 m. Here Mt. Abu (1,158 m), a small hilly block, is
separated from the main range by the valley of the Banas.

• Guru Shikhar (1,722 m), the highest peak, is situated in Mt. Abu.

• Pipli Ghat, Dewair and Desuri passes allow movement by roads and railways.

Vindhyan Range
• The Vindhyan Range, overlooking (have a view of from above) the Narmada valley, rises as an escarpment
(a long, steep slope at the edge of a plateau or separating areas of land at different heights) flanking
(neighbouring on one side) the northern edge of the Narmada-Son Trough (the rift through which the
Narmada river flows)(trough is opposite of ridge. It is a narrow depression).

• It runs more or less parallel to the Narmada Valley in an east-west direction from Jobat in Gujarat to
Sasaram in Bihar for a distance of over 1,200 km.

• The general elevation of the Vindhyan Range is 300 to 650 m.

• Most parts of the Vindhyan Range are composed of horizontally bedded sedimentary rocks of ancient age.

• The Vindhyas are continued eastwards as the Barner and Kaimur hills.

• This range acts as a watershed between the Ganga system and the river systems of south India.

• The rivers Chambal, Betwa and Ken, rise within 30 km of the Narmada.

Satpura Range
• Satpura range is a series of seven mountains (‘Sat’ = seven and ‘pura’ = mountains)
59


• It runs in an east-west direction south of the Vindhyas and in between the Narmada and the Tapti, roughly
parallel to these rivers.

• It stretches for a distance of about 900 km.

• Parts of the Satpuras have been folded and upheaved. They are regarded as structural uplift or ‘horst’.

• Dhupgarh (1,350 m) near Pachmarhi on Mahadev Hills is the highest peak.

• Amarkantak (1,127 m) is another important peak.

Western Ghats (or The Sahyadris)
• They form the western edge of the Deccan tableland.

• Run from the Tapti valley (21° N latitude) to a little north of Kanniyakumari (11° N latitude) for a distance of
1,600 km.

• The Western Ghats are steep-sided, terraced, flat-topped hills presenting a stepped topography facing the
Arabian Sea coast.

• This is due to the horizontally bedded lavas, which on weathering, have given a characteristic ‘landing stair
aspect’ to the relief of this mountain chain.

• The Western Ghats abruptly rise as a sheer wall to an average elevation of 1,000 m from the Western
Coastal Plain.

• But they slope gently on their eastern flank and hardly appear to be a mountainn when viewed from the
Deccan tableland.

• South of Malabar, the Nilgiris, Annamalai, etc. present quite different landscape due to the difference in
geological structure.

The northern section
• The northern section of the Ghats from Tapti valley to a little north of Goa is made of horizontal sheets of
Deccan lavas (Deccan Traps).

• The average height of this section of the Ghats is 1,200 m above mean sea level, but some peaks attain
more heights.

• Kalasubai (1,646 m) near Igatpuri, Salher (1,567 m) about 90 km north of Nashik, Mahabaleshwar
(1,438 m) and Harishchandragarh (1,424 m) are important peaks.

• Thal ghat and Bhor ghat are important passes which provide passage by road and rail between the Kon-
kan Plains in the west and the Deccan Plateau in the east.

60


Konkan coast == Maharashtra coast and Goa coast
Malabar Coast == Kerala and Karnataka coast
The Middle Sahyadri
• The Middle Sahyadri runs from 16°N latitude up to Nilgiri hills.

• This area is covered with dense forests.

• The western scarp is considerably dissected by headward erosion of the west flowing streams.

• The average height is 1200 m, but many peaks exceed 1500 m.

• The Vavul Mala (2,339 m), the Kudremukh (1,892 m) and Pushpagiri (1,714 m) are important peaks.

• The Nilgiri Hills which join the Sahyadris near the tri-junction of Karnataka, Kerala and TN, rise abruptly to
over 2,000 m.

• They mark the junction of the Western Ghats with the Eastern Ghats.

• Doda Betta (2,637 m) and Makurti (2,554 m) are important peaks of this area.

The southern section
• The southern part of the Western Ghats is separated from the main Sahyadri range by Pal ghat Gap (Pa-
lakkad Gap).

• The high ranges terminate abruptly on either side of this gap.

• Pal ghat Gap it is a rift valley. This gap is used by a number of roads and railway lines to connect the
plains of Tamil Nadu with the coastal plain of Kerala.

• It is through this gap that moist-bearing clouds of the south-west monsoon can penetrate some distance
inland, bringing rain to the Mysore region.

• South of the Pal ghat Gap there is an intricate system of steep and rugged slopes on both the eastern and
western sides of the Ghats.

• Anai Mudi (2,695 m) is the highest peak in the whole of southern India.

• Three ranges radiate in different directions from Anai Mudi. These ranges are the Anaimalai (1800-2000
m) to the north, the Palani (900-1,200 m) to the north-east and the Cardamom Hills or the Ealaimalai to
the south.

Eastern Ghats
• The Eastern Ghats run almost parallel to the east coast of India leaving broad plains between their base
and the coast.

61


• It is a chain of highly broken and detached hills starting from the Mahanadi in Odisha to the Vagai in
Tamil Nadu. They almost disappear between the Godavari and the Krishna.

• They neither have structural unity nor physiographic continuity. Therefore, these hill groups are generally
treated as independent units.

• It is only in the northern part, between the Mahanadi and the Godavari that the Eastern Ghats exhibit true
mountain character. This part comprises the Maliya and the Madugula Konda ranges.

• The peaks and ridges of the Maliya range have a general elevation of 900-1,200 m, and Mahendra Giri
(1,501 m) is the tallest peak here.

• The Madugula Konda range has higher elevations ranging from 1,100 m and 1,400 m with several peaks
exceeding 1,600 m. Jindhagada Peak (1690 m) in Araku Valley Arma Konda (1,680 m), Gali Konda
(1,643 m) and Sinkram Gutta (1,620 m) are important peaks.

• Between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers, the Eastern Ghats lose their hilly character and are occupied
by Gondwana formations (KG Basin is here).

• The Eastern Ghats reappear as more or less a continuous hill range in Cuddapah and Kurnool districts of
Andhra Pradesh where they are called as Nallamalai Range (Naxalite hideout in AP) with a general eleva-
tion of 600-850 m.

• The southern part of this range is called the Palkodna range.

• To the south, the hills and plateaus attain very low altitudes; only Javadi Hills and the Shevroy-Kalrayan
Hills form two distinct features of 1,000 m elevation.

• The Biligiri Rangan Hills in Coimbatore district attain a height of 1,279 m.

• Further south, the Eastern Ghats merge with the Western Ghats.

The significance of the Peninsular Plateau
• Primary Mineral Base of India: There are huge deposits of iron, manganese, copper, bauxite, chromium, mi-
ca, gold, etc.

• 98 per cent of the Gondwana coal deposits of India are found in the Peninsular Plateau.

• Besides, there are large reserves of slate, shale, sandstones, marbles, etc.

• A large part of the north-west plateau is covered with fertile black lava soil which is extremely useful for
growing cotton.

• Some hilly regions in south India are suitable for the cultivation of plantation crops like tea, coffee, rubber,
etc.

• Some low lying areas of the plateau are suitable for growing rice.

62


• The highlands of the plateau are covered with different types of forests which provide a large variety of for-
est products.

• The rivers originating in the Western Ghats offer a great opportunity for developing hydroelectricity and
providing irrigation facilities to the agricultural crops.

• The plateau is also known for its hill resorts such as Udagamangalam (Ooty), Panchmarhi, Kodaikanal,
Mahabaleshwar, Khandala, Matheron, Mount Abu, etc.

6. Coastline of India

Coastline of India
• India has a coastline of 7516.6 Km (6100 km of mainland coastline + coastline of 1197 Indian islands)
touching 13 States and Union Territories (UTs).

63


• The straight and regular coastline of India is the result of faulting of the Gondwanaland during the Creta-
ceous period.

• As such the coast of India does not offer many sites for good natural harbours.

Indented coastlines of Europe provide good natural harbours whereas African and Indian coastlines are
not indented.

• The Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea came into being during the Cretaceous or early Tertiary period
after the disintegration of Gondwanaland.

6.1 East Coast of India
• Lies between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal.

• It extends from the Ganga delta to Kanyakumari.

• It is marked by deltas of rivers like the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery.

• Chilka lake and the Pulicat lake (lagoon) are the important geographical features of the east coast.

Regional Names of The East Coast of India
• In Orissa (Odisha) it is known as Utkal coast.

• From the southern limit of the Utkal plain, stretch the Andhra coast.

• In the south of the Andhra plain is the Tamil Nadu coast.

• The Tamil Nadu coast and parts of Andhra coast together are known as Coramandal Coast or Payan Ghat.

6.2 West Coast of India
• The west coast strip extends from the Gulf of Cambay (Gulf of Khambhat) in the north to Cape Comorin
(Kanyakumari).

• Starting from north to south, it is divided into (i) the Konkan coast, (ii) the Karnataka coast and (iii) the
Kerala coast.

• It is made up of alluvium brought down by the short streams originating from the Western Ghats.

• It is dotted with a large number of coves (a very small bay), creeks (a narrow, sheltered waterway such as
an inlet in a shoreline or channel in a marsh) and a few estuaries.

• The estuaries, of the Narmada and the Tapti, are the major ones.

• The Kerala coast (Malabar Coast) has some lakes, lagoons and backwaters, the largest being the Vem-
banad Lake.

64


Regional Names of The West Coast of India
• Konkan coast ➔ Maharashtra coast and Goa coast.

• Malabar Coast ➔ Kerala and Karnataka coast.

6.3 Coastlines of Emergence and Submergence
• Coastline of emergence is formed either by an uplift of the land or by the lowering of the sea level.

• The coastline of submergence is an exact opposite case.

• Bars, spits, lagoons, salt marshes, beaches, sea cliffs and arches are the typical features of emergence.

• The east coast of India, especially its south-eastern part (Tamil Nadu coast), appears to be a coast of
emergence.

• The west coast of India, on the other hand, is both emergent and submergent.

• The northern portion of the coast is submerged as a result of faulting and the southern portion, that is the
Kerala coast, is an example of an emergent coast.

Coromandel coast (Tamil Nadu) ➔ Coastline of emergence
Malabar coast (Kerala Coast) ➔ Coastline of emergence
Konkan coast (Maharashtra and Goa Coast) ➔ Coastline of submergence
6.4 Western Coastal Plains of India
• Rann of Kachchh in the north to Kanyakumari in the South.

• These are narrow plains with an average width of about 65 km.

Kutch and Kathiawar region
• Kutch and Kathiawar, though an extension of Peninsular plateau (because Kathiawar is made of the Deccan
Lava and there are tertiary rocks in the Kutch area), they are still treated as an integral part of the Western
Coastal Plains as they are now levelled down.

• The Kutch Peninsula was an island surrounded by seas and lagoons. These seas and lagoons were later
filled by sediment brought by the Indus River which used to flow through this area. Lack of rains in recent
times has turned it into an arid and semi-arid landscape.

• Salt-soaked plain to the north of Kutch is the Great Rann. Its southern continuation, known as the Little
Rann lies on the coast and south-east of Kachchh.

65


• The Kathiawar Peninsula lies to the south of the Kachchh. The central part is a highland of Mandav Hills
from which small streams radiate in all directions (Radial Drainage). Mt. Girnar (1,117 m) is the highest
point and is of volcanic origin.

• The Gir Range is located in the southern part of the Kathiawar peninsula. It is covered with dense forests
and is famous as the home of the Gir lion.

Gujarat Plain
• The Gujarat Plain lies east of Kachchh and Kathiawar and slopes towards the west and south-west.

• Formed by the rivers Narmada, Tapti, Mahi and Sabarmati, the plain includes the southern part of Gujarat
and the coastal areas of the Gulf of Khambhat.

• The eastern part of this plain is fertile enough to support agriculture, but the greater part near the coast is
covered by windblown loess (heaps of sand).

Konkan Plain
• The Konkan Plain south of the Gujarat plain extends from Daman to Goa (50 to 80 km wide).

• It has some features of marine erosion including cliffs, shoals, reefs and islands in the Arabian Sea.

• The Thane creek around Mumbai is an important embayment (a recess in a coastline forming a bay) which
provides an excellent natural harbour.

Karnataka Coastal Plain
• Goa to Mangalore.

• It is a narrow plain with an average width of 30-50 km, the maximum being 70 km near Mangalore.

• At some places, the streams originating in the Western Ghats descend along steep slopes and make water-
falls.

• The Sharavati while descending over such a steep slope makes an impressive waterfall known as Gersoppa
(Jog) Falls which is 271 m high. (Angel falls (979 m) in Venezuela is the highest waterfall on earth. Tugela
Falls (948 m) in Drakensberg mountains in South Africa is the second highest.)

• Marine topography is quite marked on the coast.

Kerala Plain
• The Kerala Plain is also known as the Malabar Plain.

• Between Mangalore and Kanyakumari.

66


• This is much wider than the Karnataka plain. It is a low lying plain.

• The existence of lakes, lagoons, backwaters, spits, etc. is a significant characteristic of the Kerala coast.

• The backwaters, locally known as kayals are the shallow lagoons or inlets of the sea, lying parallel to the
coastline.

• The largest among these is the Vembanad Lake which is about 75 km long and 5-10 km wide and gives
rise to a 55 km long spit (Marine Landforms).

6.5 Eastern Coastal Plains of India
• Extending from the Subarnarekha river along the West Bengal-Odisha border to Kanyakumari.

• A major part of the plains is formed as a result of the alluvial fillings of the littoral zone (relating to or on
the shore of the sea or a lake) by the rivers Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery comprising some of
the largest deltas.

• In contrast to the West Coastal Plains, these are extensive plains with an average width of 120 km.

• This plain is known as the Northern Circars between the Mahanadi and the Krishna rivers and Carnatic
between the Krishna and the Cauvery rivers.

Utkal Plain
• The Utkal Plain comprises coastal areas of Odisha.

• It includes the Mahanadi delta.

• The most prominent physiographic feature of this plain is the Chilka Lake.

• It is the biggest lake and biggest brackish (salt) water (lagoon) lake in the country and its area varies
between 780 sq km in winter to 1,144 sq km in the monsoon months. Its length is around 64 km.

• South of Chilka Lake, low hills dot the plain.

• Vembanad Lake (Kerala) is the longest lake in India with a length of 96 km.

• Wular Lake (Jammu and Kashmir), is the largest freshwater lake of India (260 sq km).

• Gobind Ballabh Pant Sagar (Rihand Dam) (UP), is the largest human-made lake of India by volume.

• Shivaji Sagar Lake of Koyna Dam is the largest human-made lake of India by surface area.

• Rajasthan’s Sambhar Lake is the largest inland saltwater lake of India (200 sq km).

• Tso Lhamo Lake (Sikkim) is India’s highest lake (5,330 m) in India.

Andhra Plain
67


• South of the Utkal Plain and extends up to Pulicat Lake. This lake has been barred by a long sand spit
known as Sriharikota Island (ISRO launch facility).

• The most significant feature of this plain is the delta formation by the rivers Godavari and Krishna.

• The two deltas have merged and formed a single physiographic unit.

• The combined delta has advanced by about 35 km towards the sea during recent years. This is clear from
the present location of the Kolleru Lake which was once a lagoon at the shore but now lies far inland
(Coastline of Emergence).

• This part of the plain has a straight coast and badly lacks good harbours with the exception of Vishakha-
patnam and Machilipatnam.

Tamil Nadu Plain
• The Tamil Nadu Plain stretches for 675 km from Pulicat lake to Kanyakumari along the coast of Tamil Nadu.

Its average width is 100 km.

• The most important feature of this plain is the Cauvery delta where the plain is 130 km wide.

• The fertile soil and large scale irrigation facilities have made the Cauvery delta the granary of South India.

6.6 The significance of the Coastal Plains
• Large parts of the coastal plains of India are covered by fertile soils on which different crops are grown. Rice
is the main crop of these areas.

• Coconut trees grow all along the coast.

• The entire length of the coast is dotted with big and small ports which help in carrying out the trade.

• The sedimentary rocks of these plains are said to contain large deposits of mineral oil (KG Basin).

• The sands of Kerala coast have a large quantity of monazite which is used for nuclear power.

• Fishing is an important occupation of the people living in coastal areas.

• Low lying areas of Gujarat are famous for producing salt.

• Kerala backwaters are important tourist destinations.

• Goa provides good beaches. This is also an important tourist destination.

7. Indian Islands
• The major island groups of India are Andaman and Nicobar Archipelago (a chain of islands similar in origin)
in Bay of Bengal and Lakshadweep islands in the Arabian Sea.

68


• Andaman and Nicobar Islands were formed due to the collision between Indian Plate and Burma Minor
Plate (part of Eurasian Plate) (Similar to the formation of Himalayas).

• Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the southward extension of Arakan Yoma range (Myanmar) (Arakan
Yoma in itself is an extension of Purvanchal Hills).

• Lakshadweep Islands are coral islands. These islands are a part Reunion Hotspot volcanic chain.


Reunion Hotspot volcanic chain
• Other than these two groups there are islands in Indo-Gangetic Delta (they are more a part of the delta
than islands) and between India and Sri Lanka (Remnants of Rama Setu or Adams Bridge; formed due to
submergence).

69


Rama Setu or Adams Bridge
7.1 Andaman and Nicobar Islands
• This archipelago is composed of 265 big and small islands (203 Andaman islands + 62 Nicobar Islands).

• The Andaman and Nicobar Islands extend from 6° 45' N to 13° 45' N and from 92° 10' E to 94° 15' E for a
distance of about 590 km.

• The Andaman Islands are divided into three main islands, i.e. North, Middle and South.

• Duncan passage separates Little Andaman from South Andaman.

• The Great Andaman group of islands in the north is separated by the Ten Degree Channel from the Nico-
bar group in the south (Prelims 2014).

• Port Blair, the capital of Andaman Nicobar Islands, lies in the South Andaman.

• Among the Nicobar Islands, the Great Nicobar is the largest.

• It is the southernmost island and is very close to Sumatra island of Indonesia.

• The Car Nicobar is the northernmost island.

• Most of these islands are made of tertiary sandstone, limestone and shale resting on basic and ultrabasic
volcanoes (Similar to the Himalayas).

• The Barren Island (the only active volcano in India) and Narcondam Islands (an extinct or dormant
volcano), north of Port Blair, are volcanic islands.

• Some of the islands are fringed with coral reefs. Many of them are covered with thick forests. Most of the
islands are mountainous.

• Saddle peak (737 m) in North Andaman is the highest peak.

70


Andaman and Nicobar Islands
7.2 Lakshadweep Islands
• In the Arabian Sea, there are three types of islands.

(1) Amindivi Islands
(2) Laccadive Islands (consisting of five major islands including Kavaratti) and
(3) Minicoy.

• At present these islands are collectively known as Lakshadweep.

• The Lakshadweep Islands are a group of 25 small islands.

• They are widely scattered about 200-500 km south-west of the Kerala coast.

• Amindivi Islands are the northernmost while the Minicoy island is the southernmost.

• All are tiny islands of coral origin (coral depositions on atolls) and are surrounded by fringing reefs.

• Andrott (4.9 sq km) is the largest Island. Minicoy (4.5 sq km) is the second largest.

• Most of the islands have low elevation and do not rise more than five meters above sea level (extremely
vulnerable to sea level change).

• Their topography is flat and relief features such as hills, streams, valleys, etc. are absent.

71


Lakshadweep Islands
7.3 New Moore Island
• It is a small uninhabited offshore sandbar landform in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of the Ganges-
Brahmaputra Delta region.

• It emerged in the Bay of Bengal in the aftermath of the Bhola cyclone in 1970. It keeps on emerging and
disappearing.

• Although the island was uninhabited and there were no permanent settlements or stations located on it,
both India and Bangladesh claimed sovereignty over it because of speculation over the existence of
oil and natural gas in the region.

• The issue of sovereignty was also a part of the larger dispute over the Radcliffe Award methodology of
settling the maritime boundary between the two nations.

Drainage Systems Based on Origin
• The Himalayan Rivers: Perennial rivers: Indus, the Ganga, the Brahmaputra and their tributaries.

• The Peninsular Rivers: Non-Perennial rivers: Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna, the Cauvery, the
Narmada and the Tapti and their tributaries.

Drainage Systems Based on the Type of Drainage
• Himalayan rivers, Deccan rivers and Coastal rivers that drain into the sea.

• Rivers of the inland drainage basin (endorheic basin). Streams like the Sambhar in western Rajasthan are
mainly seasonal in character, draining into the inland basins and salt lakes. In the Rann of Kutch, the only
river that flows through the salt desert is the Luni.

8.2 Drainage Systems Based on Orientation to the sea
• The Bay of Bengal drainage (Rivers that drain into the Bay of Bengal) (East flowing rivers)
• The Arabian sea drainage (Rivers that drain into the Arabian sea) (West flowing rivers).

• The rivers Narmada and Tapti flow almost parallel to each other but empty themselves in opposite direc-
tions (West flowing).

74


• The two rivers make the valley rich in alluvial soil, and teak forests cover much of the land.

coast rivers descending from the Sahyadris.

• The area covered by The Bay of Bengal drainage and Arabian Sea drainage are not proportional to the
amount of water that drains through them.

• Over 90 per cent of the water drains into the Bay of Bengal; the rest is drained into the Arabian Sea
or forms inland drainage.

Factors responsible for the Lopsided distribution
(Why the Bay of Bengal receives more fresh water compared to the Arabian Sea?)
• The Arabian Sea drainage or Western drainage receive less rainfall (Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab receive
very low rainfall).

• The Eastern drainage or the Bay of Bengal drainage receives rainfall both from South-west and North-east
monsoons.

• Most of the Himalayan waters (perennial rivers) flow into eastern drainage (Ganges and Brahmaputra).

• Indian Rivers that flow into the Arabian Sea are seasonal or non-perennial (Luni, Narmada, etc.).

• The occurrence of more cyclonic rainfall in the eastern parts is another major reason.

8.3 Major River System or Drainage Systems in India
• The entire country has been divided into 22 basins as per the Central Water Commission.

Major Rivers and Lakes of India
78


Himalayan Rivers
1. Indus River System
2. Brahmaputra River System
3. Ganga River System
• The major Himalayan Rivers existed even before the formation of Himalayas, i.e. before the collision of In-
dian Plate with the Eurasian plate. (Antecedent Drainage)
• They were flowing into the Tethys Sea. These rivers had their source in the now Tibetan region.

• The deep gorges of the Indus, the Sutlej, the Brahmaputra etc. indicate that these rivers are older than
the Himalayas.

• They continued to flow throughout the building phase of the Himalayas; their banks were rising steeply
while the beds went lower and lower due to vertical erosion (Vertical downcutting was significant and was
occurring at a rate faster than the rising of Himalayas), thus cutting deep gorges.

• Thus, many of the Himalayan Rivers are typical examples of antecedent drainage.

Peninsular River Systems

Indus River
• India got her name from Indus.

• It flows in the north-west direction from its source (Glaciers of Kailas Range – Kailash range in Tibet near
Lake Manasarovar) till the Nanga Parbat Range.

• Its total drainage area is about 1,165,000 square km (more than half of it lies in semiarid plains of Pakistan).

• Dhar River joins it near Indo-China border.

• After entering J&K, it flows between the Ladakh and the Zaskar Ranges.

• It flows through the regions of Ladakh, Baltistan and Gilgit.

• The gradient of the river in J&K is very gentle (about 30 cm per km).

80


81


Indus River System
• Average elevation at which the Indus flows through JK is about 4000 m above sea level.

• It is joined by the Zaskar River at Leh (these kind of points are important for prelims).

• Near Skardu, it is joined by the Shyok at an elevation of about 2,700 m.

82


• The Gilgit, Gartang, Dras, Shiger, Hunza are the other Himalayan tributaries of the Indus.

• It crosses the Himalayas (ends its mountainous journey) through a 5181 m deep gorge, lying north of the
Nanga Parbat. It takes a sharp southerly bend here (syntaxial bend).

• Kabul river from Afghanistan joins Indus near Attock. Thereafter it flows through the Potwar plateau and
crosses the Salt Range (South Eastern edge of Potwar Plateau).

• Some of the important tributaries below Attock include the Kurram, Toch and the Zhob-Gomal.

• Just above Mithankot, the Indus receives from Panjnad (Panchnad), the accumulated waters of the five
eastern tributaries—the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Sutlej.

• The river empties into the Arabian Sea south of Karachi after forming a huge delta.

Jhelum River
• The Jhelum has its source in a spring at Verinag in the south-eastern part of the Kashmir Valley.

• It flows northwards into Wular Lake (north-western part of Kashmir Valley).

• From Wular Lake, it changes its course southwards. At Baramulla, the river enters a gorge in the hills.

• The river forms steep-sided narrow gorge through Pir Panjal Range below Baramula.

• At Muzaffarabad, the river takes a sharp hairpin bend southward.

• After that, it forms the India-Pakistan boundary for 170 km and emerges at the Potwar Plateau near Mirpur.

• After flowing through the spurs of the Salt Range, it debouches (emerge from a confined space into a
wide, open area) on the plains near the city of Jhelum.

• It joins the Chenab at Trimmu.

• The river is navigable for about 160 km out of a total length of 724 km.

Chenab River
• The Chenab originates from near the Bara Lacha Pass in the Lahul-Spiti part of the Zaskar Range.

• Two small streams on opposite sides of the pass, namely Chandra and Bhaga, form its headwaters at an
altitude of 4,900 m.

• The united stream Chandrabhaga flows in the north-west direction through the Pangi valley, parallel to
the Pir Panjal range.

• It enters the plain area near Akhnur in Jammu and Kashmir.

• It joins the Sutlej after receiving the waters of Jhelum and Ravi rivers.

Ravi River
83


• The Ravi has its source in Kullu hills near the Rohtang Pass in Himachal Pradesh.

• It drains the area between the Pir Panjal and the Dhaola Dhar ranges.

• After crossing Chamba, it takes a south-westerly turn and cuts a deep gorge in the Dhaola Dhar range.

• It enters Punjab Plains near Madhopur and later enters Pakistan below Amritsar.

• It debouches into the Chenab a little above Rangpur in Pakistani Punjab.

Beas River
• The Beas originates near the Rohtang Pass, at a height of 4,062 m above sea level, on the southern end
of the Pir Panjal Range, close to the source of the Ravi.

• It crosses the Dhaola Dhar range, and it takes a south-westerly direction and meets the Sutlej river at
Harike in Punjab.

• It is a comparatively small river which is only 460 km long but lies entirely within the Indian territory.

Sutlej River
• The Sutlej rises from the Manasarovar-Rakas Lakes in western Tibet at the height of 4,570 m within 80 km
of the source of the Indus.

• Like the Indus, it takes a north-westerly course up to the Shipki La on the Tibet-Himachal Pradesh bounda-
ry.

• It cuts deep gorges where it pierces the Great Himalaya and the other Himalayan ranges.

• Before entering the Punjab plain, it cuts a gorge in Naina Devi Dhar, where the famous Bhakra dam (also
known as Bhakra-Nangal Dam. The dam forms the Gobind Sagar reservoir) has been constructed.

• The Beas joins it at Harike.

• From near Ferozepur to Fazilka it forms the boundary between India and Pakistan for nearly 120 km.

• During its onward journey, it receives the collective drainage of the Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum rivers.

• It joins the Indus a few kilometres above Mithankot.

Indus water treaty
• India and Pakistan share the waters of the Indus river system according to the Indus Water Treaty signed
between the two countries on 19th September 1960.

• According to this treaty, India can utilise only 20 per cent of its total discharge of water.

• Before entering the Bay of Bengal, the Ganga, along with the Brahmaputra, forms the largest delta of the
world between the Bhagirathi/Hugli and the Padma/Meghna covering an area of 58,752 sq km.

• The coastline of the delta is a highly indented area.

• A major part of the delta is a low-lying swamp which is flooded by marine water during high tide.

Right Bank Tributaries of The Ganga
• Most of them except the Yamuna originate in the peninsular region.

Yamuna River
• Largest and most important tributary.

• It originates from the Yamunotri glacier on the Bandarpunch Peak in the Garhwal region in Uttarakhand
at an elevation of about 6,000 meters.

• It cuts across the Nag Tibba, the Mussoorie and the Shiwalik ranges.

• It emerges out of the hilly area and enters plains near Tajewala.

• Its main affluent in the upper reaches is the Tons which also rises from the Bandarpunch glacier.

• It joins the Yamuna below Kalsi before the latter leaves the hills.

• At this site, the water carried by the Tons is twice the water carried by the Yamuna.

• The Damodar river rises in the hills of the Chotanagpur plateau and flows through a rift valley.

• Rich in mineral resources, the valley is home to large-scale mining and industrial activity.

• It has a number of tributaries and sub-tributaries, such as Barakar, Konar, Bokaro, Haharo, etc.

• The Barakar is the most important tributary of the Damodar.

• Several dams have been constructed in the valley, for the generation of hydroelectric power. The valley is
called “the Ruhr of India”.

• The first dam was built across the Barakar River, a tributary of the Damodar river.

• It used to cause devastating floods as a result of which it earned the name ‘Sorrow of Bengal’. Now the
river is tamed by constructing numerous dams.

• It joins the Hugli River 48 km below Kolkata.

Left Bank Tributaries of The Ganga River
• These rivers originate in the Himalayas.

• The major tributaries apart from the Yamuna, are the Ramganga, the Gomati, the Ghaghra, the Gandak,

• Originates from the western slopes of Sumesar hills near the India-Nepal border.

• It joins the Ganga near Monghyr town.

Kosi River
• The Kosi river consists of seven streams namely and is popularly known as Saptkaushiki.

91


• These streams flow through eastern Nepal which is known as the Sapt Kaushik region.

• The sources of seven streams of the Kosi are located in snow-covered areas which also receive heavy rain-
fall.

• Consequently, a huge volume of water flows with tremendous speed.

• Seven streams mingle with each other to form three streams named the Tumar, Arun and Sun Kosi.

• They unite at Triveni north of the Mahabharata Range to form the Kosi.

• The joins the Ganga near Kursela.

• Soon after debouching onto the plain the river becomes sluggish.

• Large scale deposition of eroded material takes place in the plain region.

• The river channel is braided, and it shifts its course frequently.

• This has resulted in frequent devastating floods and has converted large tracts of cultivable land into
wasteland in Bihar. Thus, the river is often termed as the ‘Sorrow of Bihar’.

• In order to tame this river, a barrage was constructed in 1965 near Hanuman Nagar in Nepal.

• Embankments for flood control have been constructed as a joint venture of India and Nepal.

Ganga and Brahmaputra River System
• The Brahmaputra (meaning the son of Brahma). It is 2,900 km in length.

• Source: Chemayungdung glacier (Kailas Range) at an elevation of about 5,150 m.

• Its source is very close to the sources of Indus and Sutlej.

• Mariam La separates the source of the Brahmaputra from the Manasarovar Lake.

• The Brahmaputra flows eastwards in Southern Tibet for about 1,800 km.

• In Tibet, it passes through the depression formed by the Indus-Tsangpo Structure Zone between the
Great Himalayas in the south and the Kailas Range in the north.

• In spite of the exceptionally high altitude, the Tsangpo has a gentle slope.

• The river is sluggish and has a wide navigable channel for about 640 km.

• It receives a large number of tributaries in Tibet. The first major tributary is the Raga Tsangpo meeting the
Tsangpo near Lhatse Dzong.

• The river Ngangchu flows through the trade centre of Gyantse in the south and joins the main river.

• Towards the end of its journey in Tibet, its course abruptly takes a southward turn around Namcha Barwa
(7,756 m) (Syntaxial Bend).

• Here it cuts across the eastern Himalaya through the Dihang or Siang Gorge and emerges from the
mountains near Sadiya in the Assam Valley.

93


• Here it first flows under the name of Siong and then as the Dihang.

• In the north-eastern parts of Assam Valley, it is joined by two important tributaries viz, the Dibang (or Si-
kang) from the north and Lohit from the south.

• From Sadiya (Assam Valley) onwards, this mighty river is known as the Brahmaputra.

• The main streams merging with the Brahmaputra from the north are, Subansiri, Kameng, Dhansiri
(north), Raidak, Tista etc.

• The Tista was a tributary of the Ganga before the floods of 1787 after which it diverted its course eastwards
to join the Brahmaputra.

• The Brahmaputra has a braided channel (flow into shallow, interconnected channels divided by deposited
earth) for most of its passage through Assam where channels keep shifting. It carries a lot of silt, and there
is excessive meandering.

• The river is nearly 16 km wide at Dibrugarh and forms many islands, the most important of which is Majuli
(world's largest river island). It is 90 km long and measures 20 km at its widest.

• With rainfall concentrated during the monsoon months, only the river has to carry enormous quantities of
water and silt which results in disastrous floods. The Brahmaputra is thus truly a River of Sorrow.

• The river is navigable for a distance of 1,384 km up to Dibrugarh from its mouth and serves as an excellent
inland water transport route.

• The Brahmaputra bends southwards and enters Bangladesh near Dhubri.

• It flows for a distance of 270 km in the name of Jamuna river and joins the Ganga at Goalundo.

• The united stream of the Jamuna and the Ganga flows further in the name of Padma.

• About 105 km further downstream, the Padma is joined on the left bank by the Meghna, originating in the
mountainous region of Assam.

• From the confluence of Padma and Meghna, the combined river is known as the Meghna which makes a
very broad estuary before pouring into the Bay of Bengal.

• Left Bank Tributaries: Dibang, Lohit, Dhansiri, Kolong.

• Right Bank Tributaries: Kameng, Manas, Raidak, Jaldhaka, Teesta, Subansiri
8.7 Peninsular River System or Peninsular Drainage
• Rivers that drain into the Bay of Bengal: The Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna, the Cauvery and
several smaller rivers drains south-east into the Bay of Bengal.

• Rivers that drain into the Arabian Sea: The Narmada, the Tapti, the Mahi flowing west as well as sever-
al small streams originating from the Western Ghats flow westwards into the Arabian Sea.

94


• Rivers that drain into the Ganges: Tributaries of the Ganga and the Yamuna such as the Chambal, the
Betwa, the Ken, the Son and the Damodar flow in the north-easterly direction.

• Peninsula rivers are much older than the Himalayan rivers.

• The peninsular drainage is mainly concordant except for few rivers in the upper peninsular region.

• They are non-perennial rivers with a maximum discharge in the rainy season.

• The peninsular rivers have reached a mature stage and have almost reached their base level (vertical
downcutting is negligible).

• The rivers are characterized by broad and shallow valleys.

• The river banks have gentle slopes except for a limited tract where faulting forms steep sides.

• The main water divide in peninsular rivers is formed by the Western Ghats.

• The velocity of water and the load carrying capacity of the streams is low due to a low gradient.

• Most of the major rivers of the peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery
flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at their mouths.

• But the west flowing rivers of Narmada and Tapti as well as those originating from the Western Ghats and
falling in the Arabian Sea form estuaries in place of deltas.

• There are few places where rivers form superimposed and rejuvenated drainage which are represented by
waterfalls.

• Examples: The Jog (289 m) on the Sharvati river, Yenna (183 m) of Mahabaleshwar, Sivasamundram
(101 m) on the Cauvery river, Gokak (55 m) on the Gokak river, Kapildhara (23 m) and Dhuandar (15
m) on the Narmada river are the major waterfalls in the Peninsular India.

Evolution of the Peninsular Drainage
Theory 1 (most probable)
• Geologists believe that the Sahyadri-Aravalli axis was the main water divide in the past.

• According to one hypothesis, the existing peninsula is the remaining half of the bigger landmass.

• The Western Ghats were located in the middle of this landmass.

• So, one drainage was towards east flowing into the Bay of Bengal and the other towards west draining into
the Arabian Sea.

• The western part of the Peninsula cracked and submerged in the Arabian Sea during the early Tertiary pe-
riod (coinciding with the formation of Himalayas).

95


• During the collision of the Indian plate, the Peninsular block was subjected to subsidence in few regions
creating a series of rifts (trough, faults).

• The now west flowing rivers of the Peninsula, namely the Narmada and the Tapti flow through these
rifts.

• Straight coastline, steep western slope of the Western Ghats, and the absence of delta formations on
the west coast make this theory a possibility.

Theory 2
• It is believed that the west flowing peninsular rivers do not flow in the valleys formed by the rivers them-
selves.

• Rather they have occupied two fault rifts in rocks running parallel to the Vindhyas.

• These faults are supposed to be caused by the bend of the northern part of the Peninsula at the time
of upheaval of the Himalayas.

• Peninsular block, south of the cracks, tilted slightly eastwards during the event thus giving the orientation
to the entire drainage towards the Bay of Bengal.

• Criticism: Tilting should have increased the gradient of the river valleys and caused some rejuvenation of
the rivers. This type of phenomenon is absent in the Peninsula, barring a few exceptions such as waterfalls.

like magnetite, epidote, biotite, zircon, chlorite etc. (metallic minerals).

• The middle part of the basin is principally composed of phyllites, quartzites, amphiboles and granites
(rocks).

• The downstream part of the middle basin is occupied mainly by sediments and rocks of the Gondwana
group.

• The Gondwanas are principally detritals (organic matter produced by decomposition or loose matter pro-
duced by erosion) with some thick coal seams. E.g. Singareni Coal Seam (Telangana).

• The Eastern Ghats dominate the lower part of the drainage basin and are formed mainly from the Khonda-
lites.

102


• Left Bank: the Bhima, the Musi and the Munneru.

• The Koyna is a small tributary but is known for Koyna Dam. This dam was perhaps the main cause of the
devastating earthquake (6.4 on the richter scale) in 1967 that killed 150 people.

• The Bhima originates from the Matheron Hills and joins the Krishna near Raichur.

• The Tungabhadra is formed by the unification of the Tunga and the Bhadra originating from Gangamula
in the Central Sahyadri.

103


Tributaries of Krishna River
Drought and Floods in Krishna Basin
• Some parts of the basin are drought-prone.

• The delta area of the basin is subject to flooding.

• It has been observed that the river bed in the delta area is continuously raised due to silt deposition result-
ing in a reduction in carrying capacity of the channel.

• The coastal cyclonic rainfall of high intensity and short duration makes the flood problem worse.

Cauvery River
• The Kaveri (Cauvery) is designated as the Dakshin Ganga or the Ganga of the South.

104


The Godavari is known as Dakshin Ganga for its size and Kaveri is also sometimes referred to as Dakshin Ganga
because of its spiritual significance. But if you have to choose only one among these then Godavari is the
Dakshin Ganga or the Ganga of the South.

• The Cauvery River rises at an elevation of 1,341 m at Talakaveri on the Brahmagiri range, Kodagu
(Coorg) district of Karnataka.

• The Cauvery basin extends over states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Union Territory of
Puducherry draining an area of 81 thousand km2.

• It is bounded by the Western Ghats on the west, by the Eastern Ghats on the east and the south and by the
ridges separating it from Krishna basin and Pennar basin on the north.

• The Nilgiris, an offshoot of Western Ghats, extend Eastwards to the Eastern Ghats and divide the basin into
two natural regions, i.e., Karnataka plateau in the North and the Tamil Nadu plateau in the South.

• Physiographically, the basin can be divided into three parts – the Western Ghats, the Plateau of Mysore and
the Delta.

• The delta area is the most fertile tract in the basin. The principal soil types found in the basin are black soils,
red soils, laterites, alluvial soils, forest soils and mixed soils.

• Red soils occupy large areas in the basin. Alluvial soils are found in the delta areas.

• The basin in Karnataka receives rainfall mainly from the S-W Monsoon and partially from N-E Monsoon.

• The basin in Tamil Nadu receives good flows from the North-East Monsoon.

• Its upper catchment area receives rainfall during summer by the south-west monsoon and the lower
catchment area during the winter season by the retreating north-east monsoon.

• It is, therefore, almost a perennial river with comparatively fewer fluctuations in flow and is very useful
for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation.

• Thus, the Cauvery is one of the best-regulated rivers, and most of its irrigation and power production po-
tential already stands harnessed.

Tributaries of the Cauvery River
• Left Bank: the Harangi, the Hemavati, the Shimsha and the Arkavati.

• Right Bank: Lakshmantirtha, the Kabbani, the Suvarnavati, the Bhavani, the Noyil and the Amaravati joins from the right.

• The river descends from the South Karnataka Plateau to the Tamil Nadu Plains through the Shivanasam-
udram waterfalls (101 m high).

• At Shivanasamudram, the river branches off into two parts and falls through a series of falls and rapids.

105


• The falls at this point is utilised for power generation by the power station at Shivanasamudram.

• The two branches of the river join after the fall and flow through a wide gorge which is known as Mekeda-
tu (Goats leap) (Mekedatu falls is here).

• At Hogennekkal Falls, it takes Southerly direction and enters the Mettur Reservoir.

• Below Mettur reservoir the river widens with sandy bed and flows as Akhanda Cauvery.

• In the last stage, the river divides into two parts, the Northern branch being called ‘The Coleron’ and
Southern branch remains as Cauvery, and from here the Cauvery Delta begins.

• After flowing for about 16 Kms, the two branches join again to form ‘Srirangam Island’.

• On the Cauvery, branch lies the "Grand Anicut" said to have been constructed by a Chola King in 1st Cen-
tury A.D.

• Below the Grand Anicut, the Cauvery branch splits into two, Cauvery and Vennar.


Tributaries of the Cauvery River
Floods in Cauvery Basin
106


• The Cauvery basin is fan-shaped in Karnataka and leaf-shaped in Tamil Nadu. The run-off does not drain
off quickly because of its shape, and therefore no fast raising floods occur in the basin.

Projects on Cauvery River
• During the pre-plan period, many projects were completed in this basin which included Krishnarajasagar
in Karnataka, Mettur dam and Cauvery delta system in Tamil Nadu.

• Lower Bhavani, Hemavati, Harangi, Kabini are important projects completed during the plan period.

Industry in Cauvery Basin
• The city of Bangalore is situated just outside this basin.

• Important industries in the basin include the cotton textile industry in Coimbatore and Mysore, cement
factories in Coimbatore and Trichinapally and industries based on mineral and metals.

• The Salem steel plant and many engineering industries in Coimbatore and Trichinapally are also situated
in this basin.

Pennar River
• The Pennar (also known as Uttara Pinakini) is one of the major rivers of the peninsula.

Minor East flowing rivers in Peninsular India
West Flowing Rivers of Peninsular India
• The west flowing rivers of Peninsular India are fewer and smaller as compared to their east flowing coun-
terparts.

• The two major west flowing rivers are the Narmada and the Tapti.

• This exceptional behaviour is because these rivers didn’t form valleys and instead, they flow through
faults (linear rift, rift valley, trough) created due to the bending of the northern peninsula during the
formation process of Himalayas.

• These faults run parallel to the Vindhyas and the Satpuras.

• The Sabarmati, Mahi and Luni are other rivers of Peninsular India which flow westwards.

• Hundreds of small streams originating in the Western Ghats flow swiftly westwards and join the Arabian
Sea.

• Peninsular rivers which fall into the Arabian Sea do not form deltas, but only estuaries.

• This is due to the fact that the west flowing rivers, especially the Narmada and the Tapti flow through hard
rocks and hence do not carry any good amount of silt.

• Moreover, the tributaries of these rivers are very small, and hence they don’t contribute any silt.

• Hence these rivers are not able to form distributaries or a delta before they enter the sea.

Estuary

Estuary
• An estuary is a partially enclosed body of water along the coast where freshwater from rivers and streams
meets and mixes with salt water from the ocean.

• Estuaries and the lands surrounding them are places of transition from land to sea and fresh water to salt
112


water.

• Primary productivity in estuaries is very high. Fishing is a dominant occupation around estuaries. Most
of the estuaries are good bird sanctuaries.

• Although influenced by the tides, they are protected from the full force of ocean waves, winds, and
storms by such landforms as barrier islands or peninsulas. (estuaries make good ports. E.g. New York
Harbour is at the mouth of the Hudson River; Mormugao port in Goa at the mouth of the Zuari river
and Mondovi river)
• Estuarine environments are among the most productive on earth, creating more organic matter each
year than comparably-sized areas of forest, grassland, or agricultural land.

• The tidal, sheltered waters of estuaries also support unique communities of plants and animals.

• Estuaries benefits for tourism and recreational activities.

• Water draining from uplands carries sediments, nutrients, and other pollutants to estuaries. As the water
flows through estuaries, the sediments and pollutants are filtered out.

• Salt marsh grasses and other estuarine plants also help prevent erosion and stabilise shorelines (Man-
groves).

Narmada River
• The Narmada is the largest west flowing river of peninsular India.

• The Narmada flows westwards through a rift valley between the Vindhyan Range on the north and the
Satpura Range on the south.

• It rises from Maikala range near Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh, at an elevation of about 1057 m.

• Narmada basin extends over states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh.

• It is bounded by the Vindhyas on the north, Maikala range on the east, Satpuras on the south and by the
Arabian Sea on the west.

• Its total length from its source in Amarkantak to its estuary in the Gulf of Khambhat is 1,310 km.

• The hilly regions are in the upper part of the basin, and lower middle reaches are broad and fertile areas
well suited for cultivation.

• Jabalpur is the only important urban centre in the basin.

• The river slopes down near Jabalpur where it cascades (a small waterfall, especially one in a series) 15 m
into a gorge to form the Dhuan Dhar (Cloud of Mist) Falls.

• Since the gorge is composed of marble, it is popularly known as the Marble Rocks.

113


• Near Maheshwar, the river again descends from another small fall of 8 m, known as the Sahasradhara
Falls.

• There are several islands in the estuary of the Narmada of which Aliabet is the largest.

Tributaries of Narmada River
• Since the river flows through a narrow valley confined by precipitous (dangerously high or steep) hills, it
does not have many tributaries.

• The absence of tributaries is especially noted on the right bank of the river where the Hathni River is the
only exception. The other right bank tributaries are the Orsang, the Barna and the Kolar.

• A few left bank tributaries drain the northern slopes of the Satpura Range and join the Narmada at different
places.

• The major Hydro Power Project in the basin are Indira Sagar, Sardar Sarovar, Omkareshwar, Bargi &
Maheshwar.

118


119


Mahi Basin
Luni River
• The Luni or the Salt River (Lonari in Sanskrit) is named so because its water is brackish below Balotra.

• Luni is the only river basin of any significance in Western Rajasthan, which forms the bulk of arid zone.

• Luni originates from western slopes of the Aravalli ranges at an elevation of 772 m near Ajmer flowing in
South West direction and traversing a course of 511 km in Rajasthan; it finally flows into the Rann of Ka-
chchh (it gets lost in the marsh).

• The peculiarity of this river is that it tends to increase its width rather than deepening the bed because
the banks are of soils, which are easily erodible whereas beds are of sand.

• The floods develop and disappear so rapidly that they have no time to scour the bed.

120


Luni Basin
West flowing Rivers of the Sahyadris (Western Ghats)
• About six hundred small streams originate from the Western Ghats and flow westwards to fall into the Ara-
bian Sea.

121


• The western slopes of the Western Ghats receive heavy rainfall from the south-west monsoons and are able
to feed such a large number of streams.

• Although only about 3% of the areal extent flow swiftly down the steep slope and some of them make wa-
terfalls.

• The Jog or Gersoppa Falls (289 m) made by the Sharavati river is the most famous waterfall of India.

Ghaggar River – Inland Drainage
• Some rivers of India are not able to reach the sea and constitute inland drainage.

• Large parts of the Rajasthan desert and parts of Aksai Chin in Ladakh have inland drainage.

• The Ghaggar is the most important river of inland drainage.

• It is a seasonal stream which rises on the lower slopes of the Himalayas and forms boundary between Har-
yana and Punjab.

• It gets lost in the dry sands of Rajasthan near Hanumangarh after traversing a distance of 465 km.

• Earlier, this river was an affluent of the Indus, the dry bed of the old channel is still traceable.

• Its main tributaries are the Tangri, the Markanda, the Saraswati and the Chaitanya.

• It contains a lot more water in the rainy season when its bed becomes 10 km wide at places.

• Most of the streams draining western slopes of the Aravalli Range dry up immediately after they enter the
sandy arid areas to the west of this range.

1. Indian Monsoons
• The term monsoon has been derived from the Arabic word mausin or from the Malayan word monsin
meaning ‘season’.

• Monsoons are seasonal winds (Periodic Winds or Secondary winds) which reverse their direction with
the change of season.

• The monsoon is a double system of seasonal winds – They flow from sea to land during the summer
(south-west monsoon winds) and from land to sea during winter (north-east monsoon winds).

• Monsoon winds can be called as land and sea breeze on a large scale or convection cells on a large scale.

• Monsoons are peculiar to Indian Subcontinent, South East Asia, parts of Central Western Africa etc.

• They are more pronounced in the Indian Subcontinent compared to any other region.

• India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar etc. receive most of the annual rainfall during south-west
monsoon season whereas South East China, Japan etc., during north-east rainfall season.

122


• South-west monsoons bring intense rainfall to most of the regions in India and north-east monsoons
bring rainfall to mainly south-eastern coast of India (Southern coast of Andhra Pradesh and the coast of
Tamil Nadu).

• South-west monsoons are formed due to intense low-pressure system formed over the Tibetan plateau.

• North-east monsoons are associated with high-pressure cells over Tibetan and Siberian plateaus.

Factors responsible for south-west monsoon formation
• Intense heating of Tibetan plateau during summer months.

• Permanent high-pressure cell in the South Indian Ocean (east to north-east of Madagascar in summer).

Factors that influence the onset of south-west monsoons
• Above points +
• Subtropical Jet Stream (STJ).

• Tropical Easterly Jet (African Easterly Jet).

• Inter Tropical Convergence Zone.

Factors that influence the intensity of south-west monsoons
• Strengths of Low pressure over Tibet and high pressure over the southern Indian Ocean.

• Somali Jet (Findlater Jet).

• Somali Current (Findlater Current).

• Indian Ocean branch of Walker Cell.

• Indian Ocean Dipole.

Factors responsible for north-east monsoon formation
• Formation and strengthening of high-pressure cells over Tibetan plateau and Siberian Plateau in
winter.

• Westward migration and subsequent weakening of high-pressure cell in the Southern Indian Ocean.

• Migration of ITCZ to the south of India.

Theories that tried to explain the Mechanism of Indian Monsoons
• The origin of monsoons is not fully understood.

• There are several theories that tried to explain the mechanism of monsoons.

123


Classical Theory
• The first scientific study of the monsoon winds was done by Arab traders.

• Arab traders used the sea route to carry out the trade with India and monsoon patterns were of prime im-
portance for them.

• In the tenth century, Al Masudi, an Arab explorer, gave an account of the reversal of ocean currents and
the monsoon winds over the north Indian Ocean.

• In the seventeenth century, Sir Edmund Halley explained the monsoon as resulting from thermal contrasts
between continents and oceans due to their differential heating.

Indian Monsoons – Classical Theory: Sir Edmund Halley’s Theory
This theory considers Indian Monsoons as Land and Sea Breeze on a large scale.

Summer Monsoon
• In summer the sun’s apparent path is vertically over the Tropic of Cancer resulting in high temperature and
low pressure in Central Asia.

• The pressure is sufficiently high over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Hence winds flowed from Oceans
flow towards landmass in summer.

• This air flow from sea to land bring heavy rainfall to the Indian subcontinent.

Winter Monsoon
• In winter the sun’s apparent path is vertically over the Tropic of Capricorn.

• The northwestern part of India grows colder than Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal and the flow of the mon-
soon is reversed.

Drawbacks
• The monsoons do not develop equally everywhere on earth, and the thermal concept of Halley fails to ex-
plain the intricacies of the monsoons such as the sudden burst of monsoons, delay in onset of monsoons
sometimes, etc.

1.2 Mechanism of Indian Monsoons – Based on Modern Theories
Modern Theories
124


• Besides differential heating, the development of monsoon is influenced by the shape of the continents,
orography (mountains), and the conditions of air circulation in the upper troposphere (jet streams).

March to May
• As the summertime approaches, there is increased solar heating of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan
Plateau.

• During March to May, the building up of the monsoon cell is blocked by the STJ which tends to blow
to the south of the Himalayas.

• Northwest India and Plains region are occupied by Subtropical High-Pressure Belt. This high-pressure belt
undermines the influence of low-pressure cell over Tibet.

• As long as the STJ is in this position the development of summer monsoons is inhibited (the high-
pressure belt stays over north India).


125


Between Late May and Early June
126


• In the peak summer months (25th of May – 10th of Jun), with the apparent northward movement of the
sun, the southern branch of the Sub-Tropical Jetstream (STJ), which flows to the south of the Himalayas,
shifts to the north of the Himalayas.

• When the sun’s position is about to reach the Tropic of Cancer (June), the STJ shifts to the north of the
Tibetan Plateau (1st of Jun – 20th of June).

• The ITCZ is close to its peak position over the Tibetan Plateau.

• The altitude of the mountains initially disrupts the jet, but once it has cleared the summits, it is able to re-
form over central Asia.

• Its movement towards the north is one of the main features associated with the onset of the monsoon over
India.

The onset of Monsoons (1st or 2nd week of June)
• With the northward shift of STJ, an Easterly Jet is formed over the Indian plains. It generally forms in
the first week of June and lasts till late October.

• It can be traced in the upper troposphere right up to the west coast of Africa.

• The northward shift of STJ and ICTZ moves the subtropical high-pressure belt to the north of the Ti-
betan Plateau, and the Easterly Jet creates a low-pressure region in the Indian plains (Easterly Jet cre-
ates anticyclonic conditions in upper troposphere).

• With the STJ out of the way (high-pressure belt migrates to the north of Tibet) the subcontinental mon-
soon cell develops very quickly indeed, often in a matter of a few days.

• The low pressure in the northern plains coupled with the intense low of the Tibetan Plateau leads to the
sudden onset of south-west monsoons (1st of Jun – 20th of June).

• The monsoon cell is situated between the Indian Ocean (North of Madagascar) (High-Pressure Cell) and
Tibetan plateau (Low-Pressure Cell).

Rainy season
• The sub-tropical easterly jet fluctuates between the plains region of India and peninsular India vary-
ing the intensity of rainfall from location to location.

• Warmth and moisture are fed into the cell by a lower level tropical jet stream (Somali Jet) which brings
with its air masses laden with moisture from the Indian Ocean.

127


128


The end of Monsson season
• The end of the monsoon season is brought about when the atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau begins to
cool (August – October), this enables the STJ to transition back across the Himalayas.

129


• With the southward shift of ITCZ, subtropical high-pressure belt returns to the Indian plains, and the
rainfall ceases.

• This leads to the formation of an anticyclonic winter monsoon cell typified by sinking air masses over
India and relatively moisture free winds that blow seaward.

• This gives rise to relatively settled and dry weather over India during the winter months.


130


131


Indian Monsoons – Role of ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone)
132


• The southeast trade winds in the southern hemisphere and the northeast trade winds in the northern hemi-
sphere meet each other near the equator.

• The meeting place of these winds is known as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).


Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
• This is the region of ascending air, maximum clouds and heavy rainfall.

• The location of ITCZ shifts north and south of the equator with the change of season.

• In the summer season, the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of Cancer and the ITCZ shifts northwards.

• The southeast trade winds of the southern hemisphere cross the equator and start blowing in the
southwest to a northeast direction under the influence of Coriolis force.

• These displaced trade winds are called south-west monsoons when they blow over the Indian sub-
continent.

133


• The front where the south-west monsoons meet the north-east trade winds is known as the Monsoon
Front (ITCZ). Rainfall occurs along this front.

• In July, the ITCZ shifts to 20°- 25° N latitude and is located in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the south-west
monsoons blow from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.

• The ITCZ in this position is often called the Monsoon Trough (maximum rainfall).

• The seasonal shift of the ITCZ has given the concept of Northern Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (NITCZ)
in summer (July – rainy season) and Southern Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (SITCZ) in winter (Jan – dry
season).

• NITCZ is the zone of clouds and heavy rainfall that affect India.

Indian Monsoon Mechanism – Jet Stream Theory
Indian Monsoons – Modern theory: Air Mass Theory
• According to this theory, the monsoon is simply a modification of the planetary winds of the tropics.

• The theory is based on the migration of ITCZ based on seasons.

Indian Monsoon Mechanism – Modern Theory: Jet Stream Theory.

• Jet stream Theory is the latest theory regarding the origin of the monsoons.

• To understand how Jet streams, affect Indian monsoons, we need to know the basic mechanism of Jet
Stream induced weather conditions.


Trough and Ridge of a Jet Stream
134


How Jet Streams Affect Weather?

• Jet streams have distinct peaks (ridges) and troughs.

• Ridges occur where the warm air mass pushes against the cold air mass. Troughs occur where cold air mass
drops into warm air.

• The region on earth below the trough is at low pressure and the region below ridge is at high pres-
sure.

• This condition occurs due to the weakening of jet stream due to lesser temperature contrast between sub-
tropics and temperate region (our concern is STJ only).

• Usually, the trough region (the region exactly below the jet stream trough) creates a cyclonic condi-
tion (low pressure) at the surface of earth whereas the ridge regions creates an anticyclonic condition.


Jet Streak
• These ridges and troughs give rise to jet streaks which are also responsible for cyclonic and anticyclonic
weather conditions at the surface.

• The winds leaving the jet streak are rapidly diverging, creating a lower pressure at the upper level (Tropo-
pause) in the atmosphere.

• The air below rapidly replaces the upper outflowing winds. This, in turn, creates the low pressure at the
surface.

• This surface low pressure creates conditions where the surrounding surface winds rush inwards.

• The Coriolis effect creates the cyclonic rotation (cyclonic vortex) that is associated with depressions (low-
pressure cells).

135


• The winds entering the jet streak are rapidly converging because of the high pressure at the upper level
(Tropopause) in the atmosphere.

• This convergence at upper troposphere leads to divergence (high pressure) at the surface (anticyclonic
condition).

• The Coriolis effect creates the anticyclonic rotation that is associated with clear weather.

But how does this mechanism of jet streams influence Indian Monsoons?

Indian Monsoon Mechanism – Role of Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ)
• Sub-Tropical Jet stream plays a significant role in both hindering the monsoon winds as well as in
quick onset of monsoons.

STJ – Sub-Tropical Jet Stream
• The sub-tropical Jet stream is a narrow band of fast moving air flowing from west to east (Westerlies).

• STJ in northern hemisphere flows between 25° to 35° N in the upper troposphere at the height of about 12-
14 km (the height of each portion of the jet stream varies when there is meandering. Their path is
sometimes influenced by the Greater Himalayas).

• The wind speeds in a westerly jet stream are commonly 150 to 300 kmph with extreme values reaching 400
kmph.

The burst of monsoons depends upon the upper air circulation which is dominated by STJ.

Seasonal Migration of Sub-Tropical Jet Stream – STJ
• In winter STJ flows along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, but in summer it shifts northwards, rather
dramatically, and flows along the northern edge of Himalayas in early June and late summer (July-August)
along the northern Tibetan Plateau.

• The periodic movement of the Jet stream is often the indicator of the onset (STJ shits to the north of Hima-
layas in a matter of days) and subsequent withdrawal (STJ returns to its position – south of Himalayas) of
the monsoon.

• Northward movement of the subtropical jet is the first indication of the onset of the monsoon over India.

Sub-Tropical Jet Stream – STJ in Winter
• Westerly jet stream blows at a very high speed during winter over the sub-tropical zone.

136


• This jet stream is bifurcated by the Himalayan ranges (physical barrier) and Tibetan Plateau (thermal barri-
er).

• The two branches reunite off the east coast of China.

• The northern branch of this jet stream blows along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

• The southern branch blows to the south of the Himalayan ranges along 25° north latitude.

• A strong latitudinal thermal gradient (differences in temperature), along with other factors, is respon-
sible for the development of southerly jet.

• The southern branch is stronger, with an average speed of about 240 kmph compared with 70 to 90 kmph
of the northern branch.

• Air subsiding beneath this upper westerly current gives dry out blowing northerly winds from the
subtropical anticyclone over north-western India and Pakistan.

Western Disturbances
• Meteorologists believe that the southern branch of jet stream exercises a significant influence on the win-
ter weather conditions in India.

• The southern branch of the jet stream is responsible for steering of the western depressions (Western
Disturbances) from the Mediterranean Sea.

• These depressions are residual frontal cyclones which move at the height of 2000 meters from the mean
sea level. On the way, they pick up moisture from the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea.

• On an average, 4 to 6 cyclonic waves reach north-western India between October and April each year.

• Some of the depressions continue eastwards, redeveloping in the zone of jet stream confluence about 30°
N, 105° E (near the east coast of China).

Path of Western Disturbances
Weather associated with Western Disturbances
138


• The arrival of these temperate storms (remnants of temperate cyclones) (western disturbances) causes pre-
cipitation leading to an abrupt decrease in air temperature over North-West India.

• Winter rain and heat storms in north-western plains, occasional heavy snowfall in hilly regions and
cold waves in the whole of northern plains are caused by these disturbances.

Importance of Western Disturbances
• The western disturbances affect weather conditions during the winter season up to Patna (Bihar) and give
occasional rainfall which is highly beneficial for the standing rabi crops (wheat, barley, mustard, gram,
lentil, etc.).

Why there are no south-west monsoons during winter?

• Reason 1: ITCZ has left India (the winds that blow over India are mostly offshore –– land to land or land to
the ocean –– so they carry no moisture).

• Reason 2: During winter, the southern branch of STJ is strong and is to the south of Himalayas. The ridge
of the jet lies over north-western India and is associated with strong divergence of winds and creates a
high-pressure region (sub-tropical high-pressure belt) over entire north India. (This is how the mechanism
of jet streams influence Indian Monsoons in winter season)
• Reason 3: There is already a strong high pressure over Tibet. (High Pressure due to STJ + High Pressure
over Tibet = strong divergence = no rainfall)
Sub-Tropical Jet Stream – STJ in Summer
• With the beginning of summer in March, the STJ (upper westerlies) start their northward march.

• The southerly branch of STJ remains positioned south of Tibet, although weakening in intensity.

• The weather over northern India becomes hot, dry and squally due to larger incoming solar radiation and
hot winds like the loo.

• Over India, the Equatorial Trough (ITCZ) pushes northwards with the weakening of the STJ (upper wester-
lies) south of Tibet, but the burst of the monsoon does not take place until the upper-air circulation
has switched to its summer pattern.

• By the end of May, the southern jet breaks and later it is diverted to the north of Tibet Plateau, and
there is a sudden burst of monsoons (the ridge moves northwards into Central Asia = high pressure
over north-west India moves northwards into Central Asia = makes way for south-west monsoon
winds).

139


• An Easterly jet emerges over peninsular India with the northward migration of STJ.

• The upper air circulations are reversed with the emergence of Easterly jet (convergence in upper layers is
replaced by divergence == divergence in lower layers is replaced with convergence == high pressure at
lower layers is replaced by low-pressure system).

• The easterly winds become very active in the upper troposphere, and they are associated with westerly
winds in the lower troposphere (south-west monsoon winds).

• Western and eastern jets flow to the north and south of the Himalayas respectively. The eastern jet be-
comes powerful and is stationed at 15° N latitude.

• This results in more active south-west monsoon and heavy rainfall is caused.

Why no south-west monsoons in March-May (summer)?

• There is good sun’s insolation from March-May but still, there are no s-w monsoons.

Reason: The ridge region of the Southern branch of STJ creates strong divergence (high pressure) in
north-west India. The diverging air blocks incoming winds and prevents strong convergence of winds
along ITCZ.

• During the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere, low-pressure areas develop at the ground surface
near Peshawar (Pakistan) and north-west India due to intense heating of ground surface during April, May,
and June.

• As long as the position of the upper air jet stream is maintained above the surface low pressure (to the
south of Himalayas), the dynamic anti-cyclonic conditions persist over north-west India.

• The winds descending from the upper air high pressure (because of the ridge of STJ) obstructs the
ascent of winds from the surface low-pressure areas, with the result that the weather remains warm
and dry.

• This is why the months of April and May are generally dry and rainless in spite of high temperatures (low
pressure on land) and high evaporation.

Cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand

Cloudburst
• A cloudburst is an intense torrential rainfall brought by a thunderstorm that lasts for a relatively short du-
ration (few minutes to few hours).

• Cloudburst leads to flash floods and causes a lot of damage to life and property.

• Every intense rainfall is not a Cloudburst. Cloudburst specifically occurs when an air mass with high humid-
ity is struck at a place due to various reasons.

• In 2010, South-Western strip of Russia (Caucasus Region, Moscow etc.) saw higher than normal tempera-
tures (highest in the last 100 years), and there were numerous cloudbursts in Jammu and Kashmir.

• A strong upper-atmospheric high was located over European Russia towards the beginning of summer.

• It diverted the jet stream (meandering of Sub-Tropical Jet Stream) and its rain-giving train (trough) of
summer storms farther north than usual, giving much of Southern European Russia drought conditions.

• In addition, southern desert heat from central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa began to flow
northward, which strengthened this ridge of STJ and tightened its hold over the region.

141


Trough and Ridge Region in Meandering Sub-Tropical Jet Stream
• The stalled system prevented weather systems being drawn across Russia and the obstacle acted as a barri-
er trapping hot air to the south and cold air to the north.

• The consequence of this static mass of hot air was the heat wave that devastated Russia.

• With the jet stream stalled the Sub-Tropical Jet was unable to transit across the Himalayas as it would
do ordinarily, the monsoon cell to the south, fed by warmer waters in the Indian Ocean, had nowhere to go
and as a consequence it deposited vast amounts of rain over Pakistan, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and
Kashmir and this led to extensive flooding.

142


Indian Monsoons – Role of Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) (African Easterly Jet)
• The establishment and maintenance of the TEJ are not fully understood, but it is believed that the jet may
be caused by the uniquely high temperatures and heights over the Tibetan Plateau during summer.

• The TEJ plays an important role in kick-starting southwest monsoon.

• This jet descends over the Indian Ocean (near Madagascar) and intensifies its high-pressure cell so as to
move as south-west monsoon.

Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ)
• There are major high-velocity winds in the lower troposphere called low-level jets (LLJs).

• In the tropics, the most prominent of these are the Somali Jet and the African Easterly Jet (Tropical East-
erly Jet).

• The TEJ is a unique and dominant feature of the northern hemispheric summer over southern Asia and
northern Africa. The TEJ is found near between 5° and 20°N.

• It is fairly persistent in its direction, and intensity from June through the beginning of October.

• TEJ comes into existence quickly after the STJ has shifted to the north of the Himalayas (Early June).

• TEJ flows from east to west over peninsular India at 6 – 9 km and over the Northern African region.

• The formation of TEJ results in the reversal of upper air circulation patterns (High-pressure switches to
low pressure) and leads to the quick onset of monsoons.

• Recent observations have revealed that the intensity and duration of heating of Tibetan Plateau has a direct
bearing on the amount of rainfall in India by the monsoons.

• When the summer temperature of air over Tibet remains high for a sufficiently long time, it helps in
strengthening the easterly jet and results in heavy rainfall in India.

• The easterly jet does not come into existence if the snow over the Tibet Plateau does not melt. This
hampers the occurrence of rainfall in India.

• Therefore, any year of thick and widespread snow over Tibet will be followed by a year of weak
monsoon and less rainfall.

143


Permanent and Temporary Jet Streams
Indian Monsoons – Role of Tibet
• The Tibetan Plateau is an enormous block of highland acting as a formidable barrier.

• Tibet gets heated in summer and is 2 to 3 °C warmer than the air over the adjoining regions.

• Because the Tibet Plateau is a source of heat for the atmosphere, it generates an area of rising air (conver-
gence) (intense low-pressure cell).

• During its ascent, the air spreads outwards in the upper troposphere (divergence) and gradually sinks (sub-
sidence) over the equatorial part of the Indian Ocean (monsoon cell).

• It finally approaches the west coast of India as a return current from a south-westerly direction and is
termed as equatorial westerlies.

• It picks up moisture from the Indian Ocean and causes rainfall in India and adjoining countries.

• The plateau also affects the atmosphere in two ways: (a) as a mechanical barrier and (b) as a high-level
heat source.

• At the beginning of June, the subtropical jet stream is completely withdrawn from India and occupies a po-
sition along 40° N (to the north of Tibetan Plateau).

• The plateau accentuates the northward displacement of the jet stream. Hence the burst of monsoon in
June is prompted by the Himalayas and not by the thermally induced low-pressure cell over Tibet.

(Tibetan plateau is responsible for south-west monsoons. But it is the STJ that facilitates sudden out-
burst of monsoons with its sudden northward migration)
144


• In the middle of October, the plateau proves to be the most important factor in causing the advance of the
jet south of the Himalayas or bifurcating it into two parts.

• In winter Tibetan Plateau cools rapidly and produces a high-pressure cell. (Cyclonic condition over Tibet
ceases, and an anticyclonic condition is established).

• The high-pressure cell over Tibet strengthens N-E monsoons.



Indian Monsoons – Role of Tibet and STJ
145


Indian Monsoons – Role of Somali Jet
• The progress of the southwest monsoon towards India is greatly aided by the onset of Somali jet that
transits Kenya, Somalia and Sahel.

• It was observed to flow from Mauritius and the northern part of the island of Madagascar before reaching
the coast of Kenya at about 3º S.

• It strengthens permanent high near Madagascar and also helps to drive S-W monsoons towards In-
dia at a greater pace and intensity (it intensifies the monsoon cell).

• The current in the Arabian Sea associated with the Somali Jet is called as Findlater Current. Its
direction is influenced by the monsoon winds. It reverses its direction with the monsoon winds.

• Findlater Current in s-w monsoon season creates a zone of coastal upwelling near the horn of Africa
(good for fishing).

• It doesn’t have a significant impact on Indian Monsoons because the zone of upwelling is very small
unlike in the case of Indian Ocean Dipole.


Somali Current (Wikipedia)
Indian Monsoons – Role of Indian Ocean Dipole
• Indian Ocean Dipole is a recently discovered phenomena that have a significant influence on Indian mon-
soons.

• Indian Ocean Dipole is an SST anomaly (Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly – different from normal) that
occurs occasionally in Northern or Equatorial Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

146


• The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between two areas
(or poles, hence a dipole) – a western pole in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean) and an eastern
pole in the eastern Indian Ocean south of Indonesia.

• IOD develops in the equatorial region of Indian Ocean from April to May peaking in October.

• With positive IOD winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west (from Bay of Bengal towards the
Arabian Sea).

• This results in the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African Coast) being much warmer and
eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry.

• In the negative dipole year, the reverse happens to make Indonesia much warmer and rainier.

• Positive IOD is good for Indian Monsoons as more evaporation occurs in warm water.

• Similar to ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD is named as Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation
(EQUINOO) (Oscillation of pressure cells between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea).

• During the positive phase of the ‘Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO),’ there is enhanced cloud
formation and rainfall in western part of the equatorial ocean near the African coast while such activity is
suppressed near Sumatra.

Projects to understand monsoons
147


ISMEX
• Two more experiments were conducted, jointly, by India and the former USSR in 1973 and 1977, with lim-
ited participation from other countries.

• These experiments are known as the Indo-Soviet Monsoon Experiment (ISMEX) and Monsoon-77 respec-
tively.

MONEX
• Data collection effort was made under the aegis of MONEX-1979.

• It was organised jointly by many researching organizations and the World Meteorological Organisation
(WMO) under their World Weather Watch (WWW) programme.

• It is so far the largest scientific effort made to understand monsoons.

Details are not necessary. Remember the names. They can be asked in prelims. MONEX was asked in previous
papers.

2. Indian Climate
• India’s climate closely resembles the climate that of a tropical country although its northern part (north of
tropic of cancer) is situated in the temperate belt.

• The Indian subcontinent is separated from the rest of Asia by the lofty Himalayan ranges which block the
cold air masses moving southwards from Central Asia.

• As a result, during winters, the northern half of India is warmer by 3°C to 8°C than other areas located on
the same latitudes.

• During summer, due to over the head position of the sun, the climate in the southern parts resemble
equatorial dry climate.

• The north Indian plains are under the influence of hot, dry wind called ‘loo’ blowing from the Thar, Baloch
and Iranian Deserts, increasing the temperatures to a level comparable to that of the southern parts of the
country.

• Thus, the whole of India, south of the Himalayas can be climatically treated as a tropical country.

• The seasonal reversal of winds in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal give India a typical tropical monsoon cli-
mate.

• Thus, Indian climate, to be precise, is tropical monsoon type (a distinct wet and dry climate) rather than
just a tropical or half temperate climate.

148


2.1 Features of Indian Climate
• India has high regional climatic diversity because of its topographical diversity (location, altitude, distance
from sea and relief).


Typical Indian Climate
Rainfall
• The climate in most of the regions is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons.

• Some places like Thar desert, Ladakh have no wet season.

• Mean annual rainfall varies substantially from region to region.

• Mawsynram and Cherrapunji in Meghalaya receive around 1,100 cm of annual rainfall while at Jaisalmer
the annual rainfall rarely exceeds 12 cm.

• The Ganga delta and the coastal plains of Odisha see intense rainfall in July and August while the Coro-
mandel Coast (Tamil Nadu coast and Southern AP coast) goes dry during these months.

• Places like Goa, Hyderabad and Patna receive south-west monsoon rains by the first quarter of June while
the rains are awaited till early July at places in Northwest India.

Temperature
• Diurnal and annual temperature ranges are substantial.

• Highest diurnal temperature ranges occur in the Thar desert, and the highest annual temperature
ranges are recorded in the Himalayan regions.

149


• Both diurnal and mean annual temperature ranges are least in coastal regions.

• In December, the temperature may dip to – 40°C at some places in J&K while in many coastal regions aver-
age temperature is 20-25°C.

• Winters are moderately cold in most of the regions while the summers are extremely hot.

• Himalayan regions experience brutal winters while the summers are moderate.

2.2 Factors Influencing Indian Climate
• Latitudinal location
• Distance from the Sea
• The Himalayas
• Physiography
• Monsoon Winds
• Upper Air Circulation
• El Nino and La Nina
• Tropical Cyclones and Western Disturbances
Latitudinal location
• The mainland of India extends between 8°N to 37°N.

• Areas south of the Tropic of Cancer are in tropics and hence receive high solar insolation.

• The summer temperatures are extreme, and winters temperatures are moderate in most of the regions.

• The northern parts, on the other hand, lie in the warm temperate zone. They receive comparatively less so-
lar insolation.

• But summer is equally hot in north India because of hot local wind called loo.

• Winter is very cold due to cold waves brought by the western disturbances.

• Some places in Himalayas record low temperatures particularly in winter.

• Coastal regions see moderate climatic conditions irrespective of latitudinal position.

Distance from the Sea
• Coastal regions have a moderate or equable or maritime climate whereas interior locations are deprived of
the moderating influence of the sea and experience extreme or continental climate.

• The monsoon winds first reach the coastal regions and hence bring a good amount of rainfall.

150


Himalayas
• The Himalayas act as a climatic divide between India and Central Asia.

• During winter, Himalayas protect India from cold and dry air masses of Central Asia.

• During monsoon months these mountain ranges act as an effective physical barrier for rain-bearing
south-west monsoon winds (Orographic Rainfall).

• The Himalayas divide the Bay of Bengal branch of monsoon winds into two branches – one branch
flowing along the plain regions towards north-west India and the other towards South-East Asia.

• If the Himalayas were not present, the monsoon winds would simply move into China, and most of north
India would have been a desert.

Why rainfall decreases from east to west in plains region (Indus-Ganga Plains)?

• As the monsoon winds move from east to west, the moisture levels decrease due to successive rainfall at
each low-pressure regions.

• By the time winds reach western parts of the plains (Delhi, Haryana etc.) all the moisture in the monsoon
winds in exhausted.

Then how come Haryana and Punjab not deserts like Rajasthan?

• They receive rainfall due to Western Disturbances in winter. (In summer the rainfall is very low.)

Physiography
• Physiography is the most important factor that determines the mean annual rainfall received by a region.

Why are some parts in peninsular India semi-arid?

• Places on the windward side of an orographic barrier receive a great amount of rainfall whereas those
on the leeward side remain arid to semi-arid due to rain-shadow effect.

• Example: The south-west monsoon winds from the Arabian sea strike almost perpendicular at the Western
Ghats and cause copious rainfall in the Western Coastal plain and the western slopes of the Western Ghats.

• On the contrary, vast areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu lie in
rain-shadow or leeward side of the Western Ghats and receive scanty rainfall.

Why no significant rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan? Explain the formation of Thar Desert?

151


• Monsoons winds flowing in Rajasthan and Gujarat are not obstructed by any orographic barrier, and
hence these regions receive no rainfall.

• Monsoon winds blow almost parallel to Aravallis, and also, they are not of imposing height to cause oro-
graphic effect except for some places like Mount Abu; hence there is no orographic rainfall.

• No convection cell or vertical wind movements arise in Rajasthan and Gujarat: Monsoon winds blow to-
wards low-pressure cells in Tibet, and hence only horizontal wind movements exist in Gujarat and Raja-
sthan.

• Sub-tropical high-pressure belt: In winter the region experiences strong divergence because of the STJ –
Sub-Tropical Jet.

How come Cherrapunji and Mawsynram receive abnormally high rainfall?

• Mawsynram and Cherrapunji (both the places in Khasi Hills, Meghalaya) are the wettest places on
earth with mean annual rainfall over 1100 cm.

• Copious rainfall in these places is due to the funnelling effect followed by orographic upliftment
(Khasi Hills).

• Funnelling effect: clouds are channelled into a narrow region between mountains and hence the cloud den-
sity is extraordinary.


Funnelling Effect
Monsoon Winds
• The most dominating factor of the Indian climate is the 'monsoon winds'.

Important features of Indian Monsoons are
1. Sudden onset (sudden burst)
2. Gradual progress
152


3. Gradual retreat
4. Seasonal reversal of winds
• The complete reversal of the monsoon winds brings about a sudden change in the seasons.

• The harsh summer season is suddenly gives way to monsoon or rainy season.

• The south-west monsoons from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal bring rainfall to the country.

• The north-eastern winter monsoon does not cause much rainfall except along the Coromandel coast (TN
coast) after getting moisture from the Bay of Bengal.

Upper Air Circulation
The changes in the upper air circulation over Indian landmass is brought about by Jet streams.

Westerly Jet Stream
• Westerly jet stream blows at a very high speed during winter over the sub-tropical zone.

• The southern branch of the jet stream exercises a significant influence on the winter weather conditions in
India.

• This jet stream is responsible for bringing western disturbances from the Mediterranean region into the
Indian sub-continent.

• Winter rain and heat storms in north-western plains and occasional heavy snowfall in hilly regions are
caused by these disturbances.

• These are generally followed by cold waves in the whole of northern plains.

Easterly Jet Stream
• The reversal in upper air circulation takes place in summer due to the apparent shift of the sun's vertical
rays in the northern hemisphere.

• The westerly jet stream is replaced by the easterly jet stream which owes its origin to the heating of the
Tibet plateau.

• This helps in the sudden onset of the south-west monsoons.

Tropical Cyclones and Western Disturbances
• Tropical cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea and the influence large parts of
peninsular India.

153


• Majority of the cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and influence the weather conditions during the
south-west monsoon season (low-intensity cyclones).

• Some cyclones are born during the retreating monsoon season, i.e., in October and November (high-
intensity cyclones) and influence the weather conditions along the eastern coast of India.

• The western disturbances originate over the Mediterranean Sea and travel eastward under the influence of
westerly jet stream.

• They influence the winter weather conditions over most of Northern-plains and Western Himalayan region.

El-Nino, La Nina and ENSO
El Nino
• Adversely affects monsoon rainfall and cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal.

• Good for cyclogenesis in the Arabian Sea.

• Droughts are common during El Nino events due to less monsoonal and cyclonic rainfall.

La Nina
• Good for monsoons and cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal.

• Suppressed cyclogenesis in the Arabian Sea.

• Floods are common.

ENSO
• Southern Oscillation is simply the oscillation or alternating positions of low pressure and high-pressure cells
over eastern and western Pacific.

• Southern Oscillation coinciding with El Nino is called ENSO or El Nino Southern Oscillation. (SO usually co-
incides with EL Nino. This is why El Nino is usually referred to as ENSO)
• ENSO = (warm water in eastern Pacific + low pressure over eastern Pacific) + (cool water in western Pacific
+ high pressure in western Pacific)
• Climatic conditions are same as El Nino.

2.3 Indian Climate – Seasons
• The cold weather season or winter season,
• The hot weather season or summer season,
154


• The south-west monsoon season or Rainy season, and
• The season of the retreating monsoon or cool season.

Winter Season in India

Mean Temperature in January
• November to March. January is the coldest month.

• Sun’s apparent path is to the south of the equator.

• Clear sky, pleasant weather, low temperature, low humidity, high range of temperature, cool and
slow north-east trade winds.

• The diurnal range of temperature, especially in interior parts of the country, is very high.

The temperature in Winter Season
• The isotherm of 20°C runs roughly parallel to the Tropic of Cancer.

155


• To the south of this isotherm, the temperatures are above 20 °C.

• Here there is no distinctly defined winter weather.

• Some parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu typically experience temperatures near 30 °C.

• To the north mean temperatures are below 21 °C and the winter weather is distinct.

• The mean minimum temperature is about 5 °C over north-west India and 10 °C over the Gangetic plains.

• Dras Valley in Kashmir is the coldest place in India.

• The minimum temperature recorded at Dras was – 45 °C in 1908.

The pressure in Winter Season
• High air pressure prevails over large parts of north-west India due to low temperatures coupled with
divergence induced by the ridge of the STJ.

• Pressure is comparatively lower in south India.

• The winds start blowing from high-pressure area of the north-west to low-pressure area of the south-east.

• The wind velocity is low due to a low pressure gradient.

156


Prevailing winds and Cyclones paths in January
Western Disturbances in Winter Season
• The spell of fine weather over north-western and northern India is often broken due to the inflow of west-
ern disturbances.

• They intensify over Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana.

• They move eastwards across the sub-Himalayan belt up to Arunachal Pradesh.

• They cause light rain in the Indus-Ganga plains and snowfall in the Himalayan belt.

• After the passage of the disturbance, widespread fog and cold waves lowering the minimum temperature
by 5° to 10°C below normal are experienced.

Tropical Cyclones in Winter Season
157


• This is the season of least tropical cyclone activity.

• The frequency of tropical cyclones decreases with the advancement of the season.

• This is due to low sea surface temperature and exit of ITCZ farthest south.

• The storms which are born in the Bay of Bengal strike Tamil Nadu and bring heavy rainfall.

• Some of them cross the southern peninsula over to the Arabian Sea.

• Some storms originate in the Arabian Sea and move towards either north or west.

Precipitation in Winter Season
• The retreating winter monsoons pick up some moisture while crossing the Bay of Bengal and cause
winter rainfall in Tamil Nadu, south Andhra Pradesh, south-east Karnataka and south-east Kerala
(Usually in the first weeks of November).

• Most of it occurs along the south-eastern coast of Tamil Nadu and adjoining parts of Andhra Pradesh.

• The western disturbances also cause a little rainfall in north-west India.

• The amount of rainfall gradually decreases from the north and north-west to the east (it is opposite in rainy
season).

• The north-eastern part of India also gets rainfall during the winter months.

Precipitation in NE Monsoon Season
160


Summer Season in India
• March to June.

• High temperature and low humidity are the chief characteristics.

• It is sometimes referred to as the pre-monsoon period.

The temperature in Summer Season
• High sun’s insolation due to the apparent movement of sun between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer.

• The southern parts of the country are distinctly warmer in March and April whereas, in June, north
India has higher temperatures.

• In March, the highest temperatures occur in the southern parts (40-45 °C).

• In April the highest temperature of about 45 °C is recorded in the northern parts of Madhya Pradesh.

• In May the highest temperature shifts to Rajasthan where temperatures as high as 48 °C may be recorded.

• In June the maximum temperature is in Punjab and Haryana.

• The highest temperatures recorded are 50.5 °C at Alwar on 10th May 1956 and 50.6 °C at Ganganagar on
14th June 1935.

• The highest temperatures are recorded just before the onset of the southwest monsoons (late May).

• The diurnal range of temperature is also very high. It may be as high as 18°C in some parts.

• The temperatures along the west coast are comparatively lower than those prevailing on the east coast due
to the prevailing westerly winds.

• Northern and central parts of India experience heat waves in this season.

(A heat wave is an abnormally high temperature experienced by a region. A temperature increase of the order of
6° to 7 °C above normal is termed as 'moderate' and 8 °C and more as 'severe' heat wave)
• The heat waves strike by the end of April, and their maximum occurrence is in May.

• Most of the heat waves develop over Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (location far away from the sea). From
here they spread over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

• The strong northwesterly winds (caused due to strong divergence in north-west India) with a long land
journey over hot regions check the onward march of the sea breeze over the eastern coastal belt and create
heatwave conditions over Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.

• Heat waves are rare over the peninsula south of 13 °N latitude due to maritime conditions prevailing there.

The pressure in Summer Season
161


• The atmospheric pressure is low all over the country due to high temperature.

• But strong dynamically induced divergence over north-west India prevents the onset of south-west
monsoons.

Winds in Summer Season

Prevailing winds and Cyclones paths in April
• There is a marked change in the direction and speed of the winds from winter.

• The winds are by and large light and variable.

Loo
• Loo winds originate over Iranian, Baloch and Thar deserts.

• In May and June, the high temperature in northwest India builds steep pressure gradient.

• Hot, dust-laden and strong wind known as loo blows.

162


• Loo normally starts blowing by 9.00 A.M., increases gradually and reaches maximum intensity in the after-
noon.

• It blows with an average speed of 30-40 km per hour and persists for days.

Andhis
• The strong dust storms resulting from the convective phenomena are locally known as andhis (blinding
storms). They move like a solid wall of dust and sand.

• The wind velocity often reaches 50-60 kmph, and the visibility is reduced to a few metres.

• Such dust storms are common in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu region, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and
Madhya Pradesh.

• They are short-lived. The squall and showers which follow these storms bring down the temperature sharply
temporarily.

Frontal Thunderstorms in Summer Season
• The strong convectional movements related to the westerly jet stream lead to thunderstorms in the eastern
and north-eastern part of the country.

• They normally originate over Chota Nagpur plateau and are carried eastwards by westerly winds.

• The areas with the highest incidence of thunderstorms are Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram,
Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, West Bengal and the adjoining areas of Odisha and Jharkhand .

Norwesters and Thunderstorms in Summer Season
• In West Bengal and the adjoining areas of Jharkhand, Odisha and Assam, the direction of squalls is mainly
from the northwest, and they are called norwesters.

• They are often very violent with squall speeds of 60 to 80 km per hour.

• The rainfall brought by the norwesters is known as the spring storm showers.

• Hailstones sometimes accompany showers and occasionally attain the size of a golf ball.

• They cause heavy damage to standing crops, livestock and even lead to loss of human lives.

• However, they are, sometimes, useful for tea, jute and rice cultivation. In Assam, these storms are known as
Tea Showers and Barodoli Chheerha.

• The period of maximum occurrence of these storms is the month of Vaisakh (mid-March to mid-April), and
hence, they are locally known as Kalabaisakhis, the black storms or a mass of dark clouds of Vaiasakha.

Convectional Thunderstorms in Summer Season
163


• In the south, the thunderstorms occur in Kerala and adjoining parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, particu-
larly during evenings and nights.

• In Karnataka, they are called cherry blossoms or blossom showers due to their effect on the coffee plan-
tations.

• Such showers are called mango showers in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh because they are very
beneficial to mango crop.

Western Disturbances in Summer Season
• Their frequency and intensity gradually decrease with the advancement of summer.

• Approximately 4, 3 and 2 western disturbances visit north-west India in March, April and May respectively.

• They cause snowfall in higher reaches of the Himalayas.

Tropical Cyclones in Summer Season
• Tropical cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

• A few cyclones are formed in the Bay of Bengal in the month of March, but they do not affect the mainland
of India.

• Their frequency rises steeply in April, and the number of cyclones originating in May is more than double
than those originating in April.

• About three-fourths of the tropical cyclones are born in the Bay of Bengal, and the rest originate in the
Arabian Sea.

• Most of the depressions in April originate to the south of 10 °N while those originating in May are born to
the north of this latitude.

• Most of the storms of this season initially move west or north-west, but later they recurve northeast and
strike Bangladesh and the Arakan Coast of Myanmar.

• Very few hit the Indian coast while some dissipate over the sea itself.

• The coastal areas of Bangladesh and Arakan Coast of Myanmar are liable to be hit by tropical storms in
May. Many of them are quite severe and cause heavy damage to life and property.

• In the Arabian Sea, major storms are formed in May between 7° and 12° N latitudes.

• Most of them move away from the Indian coast in a north-westerly direction and dissipate in the sea.

• Few originate close to the Indian coast. They move towards the north-east and hit somewhere along the
west coast of India.

164


Precipitation in Summer Season
• This season is not totally rainless (only one per cent of the annual rainfall).

• In the north-eastern parts of the country, dust storms bring little rainfall.

• The precipitation in Kashmir is mainly in the form of snow caused by western disturbances.

• The norwesters bring some rainfall in Assam, West Bengal and Odisha. The intensity of rainfall is high.

• Coastal areas of Kerala and Karnataka receive rainfall from thunderstorms.

165


Precipitation in Summer (March to May)
166


Rainy Season – South West Monsoon Season
• South West Monsoon Season – June to mid-September.

• South West Monsoon Season is also known as a hot-wet season.

The temperature during South West Monsoon Season
• Sudden onset of South West Monsoons leads to a significant fall in temperature (3° to 6 °C).

• The temperature remains less uniform throughout the rainy season.

• The temperature rises in September with the cease of south-west monsoons.

• There is a rise in temperature whenever there is a break in the monsoons.

• The diurnal range of temperature is small due to clouds and rains.

• The highest temperatures are experienced at places west of the Aravalli (38° to 40 °C). This is due to the
lack of clouds and hot continental air masses.

• Other parts of Northwest India also have temperatures above 30 °C.

• The temperatures are quite low over the Western Ghats due to heavy rainfall.

• The coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and adjoining parts of Andhra Pradesh have temperatures above 30 °C as
they receive little rainfall during this season.

Pressure and Winds During South West Monsoon Season
• Low-pressure conditions prevail over northwest India due to high temperature.

• ITCZ (monsoon trough) lies along the Ganga plain.

• There are frequent changes in its location depending upon the weather conditions.

• The atmospheric pressure increases steadily southwards.

• Over the peninsular region, due to the pressure gradient between north and south, winds blow in a south-
west to northeast direction from Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal.

• Their direction undergoes a change in Indo-Gangetic plain where they move from east to west.

Rainfall During South West Monsoon Season
• Three-fourths of the total annual rainfall is received during this season.

• The average rainfall over the plains of India in this season is about 87 per cent.

• Normal date of the arrival of the monsoon is 20th May in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

• The advance of the monsoon is much faster in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea.

167


Precipitation in South West monsoon Season
168


• The normal date of onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala, i.e. the first place of entry in the main-
land of India is 1st June.

• The monsoons advance quickly accompanied with a lot of thunder, lightning and heavy downpour. This
sudden onset of rain is termed as monsoon burst.

• Sometimes monsoons are delayed, or they come much earlier than normal.

• Normally the onset occurs between 29th May and 7th June.

South West Monsoon – Arabian Sea branch and Bay of Bengal branch
• Monsoon winds beyond south Kerala progress in the form of two branches viz. the Arabian Sea branch
and the Bay of Bengal branch.



South West Monsoon – Arabian Sea branch and Bay of Bengal branch
• The Arabian Sea branch gradually advances northwards. It reaches Mumbai by 10th June.

169


• The Bay of Bengal branch spreads rather rapidly over most of Assam. The normal date of its arrival at Kolka-
ta is 7th June.

• On reaching the foothills of the Himalayas, the Bay branch is deflected westward by the Himalayan bar-
rier, and it advances up the Gangetic plain.

• The two branches merge with each other mostly around Delhi to form a single current.

• Both the branches reach Delhi more or less at the same time.

• By the end of June, the monsoon is usually established over most parts of the country.

• By mid-July, the monsoon extends into Kashmir and the remaining parts of the country.

• By this time, it reaches Kashmir; it has shed most of its moisture.

• Arabian Sea branch of the monsoon is much powerful than the Bay of Bengal branch for reasons:
1. The Arabian Sea is larger than the Bay of Bengal, and
2. the entire Arabian Sea current advances towards India, whereas only a part of the Bay of Bengal
current, enters India, the remainder proceeding to Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia.

The Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoons is divided into three distinct streams on arriving in the
mainland of India.

• The first stream strikes the west coast of India and gives extremely heavy rainfall of over 250 cm.

• It strikes perpendicular to the Western Ghats causing plentiful Orographic Rainfall (400 to 500 cm annual
rainfall on the windward side).

• Rainfall is drastically reduced to about 30-50 cm on the leeward side of the crest.

• There is a narrow belt of marked aridity on the immediate leeward side of the Western Ghats. But once it is
passed, the air starts rising again and the amount of rainfall increases further east.

• The second stream enters Narmada—Tapti troughs (narrow rift valley) and reaches central India.

• It does not cause much rain near the coast due to the absence of major orographic obstacle across the rift.

• Some parts of central India receive rainfall from this stream (Ex: Nagpur).

• The third stream moves parallel to the Aravalli Range without causing much rainfall.

• Consequently, the whole of Rajasthan is a desert area.

• However, some orographic effect is occurring on the south-eastern edge of the Aravalli Range.

Mount Abu gets about 170 cm rainfall while the surrounding plains have only 60 to 80 cm rainfall.

The Bay of Bengal Branch of the southwest monsoon is divided into two distinct streams.

• The first stream crosses the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta and reaches Meghalaya.

170


• Here that the orographic effect results in intense rainfall.

• Cherrapunji receives an annual rainfall of 1,102 cm, a major portion of which occurs from June to August.

• Mawsynram (present champion) located at 1,329 m above sea level just 16 km to the west of Cherrapun-
ji (X champion) records higher annual rainfall of 1,221 cm.

• Both the stations are located on the southern slopes of the Khasi hills at the northern end of a deep valley
running from south to north.

• The second stream of the Bay of Bengal branch moves along Himalayan foothills as they are deflected to
the west by the Himalaya and brings widespread rainfall to Ganga plain.

• The rainfall by this stream is characterized by a steady decline as we move from east to west up the plain.

(Previous Prelims Question)
• The Tamil Nadu coast remains relatively dry during the south-west monsoon period because of
1. rain shadow effect of the Arabian Sea current and
2. Bay of Bengal current which flows parallel to the coast.

Break in the South West Monsoons
• During July and August, there are certain periods when the monsoons become weak.

• Rainfall practically ceases over the country outside the Himalayan belt and southeast peninsula.

• This is known as a break in the monsoon.

• During the break period, heavy rainfall occurs over the sub-Himalayan regions and the southern slopes of
the Himalayas.

• On an average one or two breaks do occur during the rainy season.

• 85 out of 100 years there is a break in the monsoons.

What causes monsoon break?

• The breaks are believed to be brought about by the northward shifting of the monsoon trough (minimum
low-pressure cells in ITCZ) to the foothills of Himalayas.

• This leads to a sharp decrease in rainfall over most parts of the country but increases along the Hima-
layas and parts of Northeast India and the Southern Peninsula.

• Breaks are likely to occur during the second week of August and last for a week.

• The breaks can also occur due to tropical cyclones which originate in the Bay of Bengal.

171


The monsoon trough is a portion of the Intertropical Convergence Zone as depicted by a line on a weather map
showing the locations of minimum sea level pressure, and as such, is a convergence zone between the wind pat-
terns of the southern and northern hemispheres.

Depressions in South West Monsoon Season
• A major part of the South West Monsoon rainfall is generated by depressions (intense low pressure) origi-
nating in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Some depressions develop over land also.

• About 3-4 depressions are formed per month from June to September.

• Almost all of them are sucked inward through the deltas of great rivers (depressions need moisture to be
alive), the Ganga, the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery and cause heavy rain in these
areas.

• The location of depressions strongly coincides with the latitudinal position of ITCZ.

• Most of the depression originate to the west of 90⁰ E in the Bay of Bengal and move in the north-west di-
rection.

• In the Arabian Sea in June-July, the depressions move either in the north-west or in the northerly direction
and may affect west Gujarat or Maharashtra.

• Storms during August and September are rare and are formed close to Maharashtra-Gujarat coast.

• Most of the rainfall in central and northern parts of the country is caused by these depressions.

• The absence of depressions or a change in their tracks result in deficit or no rain.

Advance and Withdrawal of South West Monsoons
172


173


Advance and Withdrawal Dates of South West Monsoons
Chief Characteristics of South West Monsoon Rainfall
• A major part of monsoon rains is received between June and September.

• Monsoonal rainfall is largely governed by relief and is orographic in its mode.

• The amount of rainfall decreases with increasing distance from the sea.

• The rainless interval during south-west monsoon season is known as breaks.

• There are large scale spatial variations in the distribution of rainfall.

• Monsoons often fail to keep the date. Sometimes the monsoons withdraw before the scheduled time caus-
ing considerable damage to the crops.

174


North East Monsoon Season – Retreating Monsoon Season
• Starts with the beginning of the withdrawal of southwest monsoon (middle of September – November).

• The monsoons withdraw from the extreme north-west end of the country in September, from the peninsula
by October and from the extreme south-eastern tip by December.

• In Punjab, the south-west monsoons reach in the first week of July and withdraw from there in the second
week of September.

• The south-west monsoons reach Coromandel coast in the first week of June and withdraw from there only
in the middle of December.

• Unlike the sudden burst of the advancing monsoons, the withdrawal is rather gradual and takes about
three months.

The temperature during Retreating Monsoon Season
• With the retreat of the monsoons, the clouds disappear, and the sky becomes clear.

• The day temperature starts falling steeply.

• The diurnal range of temperature increases due to the lack of cloud cover.

Pressure and Winds during Retreating Monsoon Season
• As the monsoons retreat, the monsoon trough weakens and gradually shifts southward.

• Unlike south-west monsoon, the onset of the north monsoon is not clearly defined.

• The direction of winds over large parts of the country is influenced by the local pressure conditions.

Cyclones during Retreating Monsoon Season
• Most severe and devastating tropical cyclones originate in the Indian seas especially in the Bay of Ben-
gal.

• The highest frequency of the cyclones is in the month of October and the first half of November.

More cyclones are born in October and then in November, and more cyclones originate in the Bay of
Bengal than in the Arabian Sea.

• In October, the Cyclones of the Bay of Bengal originate between 8°N and 14°N.

• Initially, they move in west or north-westerly direction, but many of them later recurve and move towards
the north-east.

• Near 55 per cent of the Bay storms cross or affect the Indian coast.

175


• The area’s most vulnerable to these storms include the coastal belts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha
and West Bengal.

• Many of the cyclones which strike the eastern coast of India, south of 15°N latitude cross the southern Pen-
insula and enter the Arabian Sea.

• During this process, they may weaken, but on re-entry over the Arabian sea they intensify into cyclonic
storms.

• The storms of Arabian sea originate between 12°N and 17°N latitudes in October and between 8° N and
13° N latitudes in November.

• Generally, they move away from the coast in a north-westerly direction. But about 25% of them later re-
curve northeast and strike the Maharashtra or Gujarat coast.

• In north-west India, the western disturbances produce clouding and light rainfall in the otherwise fine
weather.

• The precipitation is in the form of snow in higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and in
Kumaon Hills.

Precipitation during Retreating Monsoon Season
• The humidity and cloud cover are much reduced with the retreat of the south-west monsoons, and most
parts of the country remain without much rainfall.

• October-November is the main rainy season in Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of Andhra Pradesh to
the south of the Krishna delta as well as a secondary rainy period for Kerala.

• The retreating monsoons absorb moisture while passing over the Bay of Bengal and cause this rainfall.

Isohyet (the line joining places of equal rainfall) [Compare this with isotherm (temperature), isobar
(pressure)]
Areas of very high rainfall
• Areas receiving an annual rainfall of 200 cm and above.

• These include the western side of Western Ghats (Thiruvananthapuram in the south to Mumbai in the
north).

• The average annual rainfall in this belt is 200-400 cm.

• Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, parts of Manipur, Tripura and north-
eastern tip of West Bengal also receive 200 cm or more, with isolated pockets receiving over 400 cm.

Meghalaya (the abode of clouds) is the wettest part of the country with Mawsynram and Cherrapunji
getting 1,221 and 1,102 cm of annual rainfall respectively.

Areas of high rainfall
• 100-200 cm annual rainfall.

• Eastern slopes of the Western Ghats, the major part of the northern plain, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

Areas of low rainfall
• 50-100 cm annual rainfall.

• Large parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, western Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, eastern Raja-
sthan, Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh.

Areas of very low rainfall
• These are desert and semi-desert areas receiving less than 50 cm of annual rainfall.

• They include large areas of western Rajasthan, Kachchh and most of Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir.

2.4 Climatic Regions of India
• While classifying Indian climatic regions, most geographers have given more importance to rainfall than to
temperature as variations in rainfall are much more marked than those of temperature.

Here we will see two classifications – Stamp's and Koppen’s. For GS this is more than enough.

178


Stamp's Classification of Climatic Regions of India
• Stamp used 18 °C isotherm of mean monthly temperature for January to divide the country into two broad
climatic regions, viz., temperate or continental zone in the north and tropical zone in the south.

• This line runs roughly across the root of the peninsula, more or less along or parallel to the Tropic of Can-
cer.

• The two major climatic regions are further divided into eleven regions depending upon the amount of rain-
fall and temperature.

Temperate or Continental India
1. The Himalayan region (heavy rainfall)
2. The north-western region (moderate rainfall)
3. The arid low land
4. The region of moderate rainfall
5. The transitional zone
Tropical India
1. Region of very heavy rainfall
2. Region of heavy rainfall
3. Region of moderate rainfall

Koppen’s Classification of Climatic Regions of India
• Koppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate.

• He selected certain values of temperature and precipitation and related them to the distribution of vegeta-
tion and used these values for classifying the climates.

• Koppen divided India into nine climatic regions making use of the above scheme.

3. Natural Vegetation of India
• Climate, soil and topography are the major factors that influence Natural Vegetation of a place.

• The main climatic factors are rainfall and temperature.

• The amount of annual rainfall has a great bearing on the type of vegetation.

Annual Rainfall
Type of Vegetation
200 cm or more
Evergreen Rain Forests
100 to 200 cm
Monsoon Deciduous Forests
50 to 100 cm
Drier Deciduous or Tropical Savanna
25 to 50 cm
Dry Thorny Scrub (Semi-arid)
Below 25 cm
Desert (Arid)
• Temperature is the major factor in the Himalayas and other hilly regions with an elevation of more than 900
metres.

• As the temperature falls with altitude in the Himalayan region the vegetal cover changes with altitude from
tropical to sub-tropical, temperate and finally alpine.

183


• The soil is an equally determining factor in a few regions. Mangrove forests, swamp forests are some of
the examples where the soil is the major factor.

• Topography is responsible for certain minor types, e.g. alpine flora, tidal forests, etc.

3.1 Classification of Natural Vegetation of India
• Classification of Natural Vegetation of India is primarily based on spatial and annual variations in rainfall.

• Temperature, soil and topography are also considered.

• India's vegetation can be divided into 5 main types and 16 sub-types as given below.

A. Moist Tropical Forests
1. Tropical Wet Evergreen
2. Tropical Semi-Evergreen
3. Tropical Moist Deciduous
4. Littoral and Swamp
B. Dry Tropical Forest
1. Tropical Dry Evergreen
2. Tropical Dry Deciduous
3. Tropical Thorn
C. Montane Sub-Tropical Forests
1. Sub-tropical broad leaved hill
2. Sub-tropical moist hill (pine)
3. Sub-tropical dry evergreen

Classification of Natural Vegetation of India
Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests or Rain Forests
185


Climatic Conditions
• Annual rainfall exceeds 250 cm.

• The annual temperature is about 25-27 °C
• The dry season is distinctly short.

Characteristics
• Evergreen: Due to high heat and high humidity, the trees of these forests do not shed their leaves to-
gether.

• Vegetation is mesophytic: Plants adapted to neither too dry nor too wet type climate or soil.

Hydrophytic plants: plants like water lily or pondweed that grow in saturated soil
Xerophytic plants: plants like cactus that grow in extremely dry soil.

Mesophytic plants: ordinary plants that exist between the two extremes.

• Lofty: The trees often reach 45-60 metres in height.

• Thick Canopy: From the air, the tropical rain forest appears like a thick canopy of foliage.

• All plants struggle upwards for sunlight resulting in a peculiar layer arrangement.

• Less undergrowth: The sunlight cannot reach the ground due to thick canopy. The undergrowth is formed
mainly of bamboos, ferns, climbers, orchids, etc.

Distribution
• The western side of the Western Ghats (500 to 1370 metres above sea level).

• Some regions in the Purvanchal hills.

• In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Timber
• Hardwood: The timber of these forests is fine-grained, hard and durable but is hard to exploit.

• The important species of these forests are mahogany, mesua, white cedar, jamun, canes, bamboo etc.

Tropical Semi-Evergreen Forests
• They are transitional forests between tropical wet evergreen forests and tropical deciduous forests.

• They are comparatively drier areas compared to tropical wet evergreen forests.

Climatic Conditions
186


• Annual rainfall is 200-250 cm.

• Mean annual temperature varies from 24 to 27 °C.

Distribution
• Western coast, Assam, Lower slopes of the Eastern Himalayas, Odisha and Andamans.

Characteristics
• The semi-evergreen forests are less dense.

• They are more gregarious (living in flocks or colonies – more pure stands) than the wet evergreen for-
ests.

• These forests are characterized by many species.

• Trees usually have buttressed trunks with abundant epiphytes.


Tress with buttressed trunks and epiphytes
• The important species are laurel, rosewood, mesua, thorny bamboo – Western Ghats; white cedar, Indi-
an chestnut, champa, mango, etc. – Himalayan region.

Timber
• Hardwood: Similar to that in tropical evergreen forests except that these forests are less dense with more
pure stands (timber industry here is better than in evergreen forests).

Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests
Climatic Conditions
187

• It is comparatively easy to exploit these forests due to their high degree of gregariousness (more
pure stands).

Littoral and Swamp Forests
• They can survive and grow both in fresh as well as brackish water (The mixture of seawater and fresh water
in estuaries is called brackish water, and its salinity can range from 0.5 to 35 ppt).

188


• Occur in and around the deltas, estuaries and creeks prone to tidal influences (delta or tidal forests).

• Littoral (relating to or on the shore of the sea or a lake) forests occur at several places along the coast.

• Swamp forests are confined to the deltas of the Ganga, the Mahanadi, the Godavari (Coringa Wildlife
Sanctuary), the Krishna and the Cauvery.

• Dense mangroves occur all along the coastline in sheltered estuaries, tidal creeks, backwaters, salt marshes
and mudflats. It provides useful fuelwood.

• The most pronounced and the densest is the Sundarbans in the Ganga delta where the predominant spe-
cies is Sundri (Heriteera).

Timber
• It provides hard and durable timber which is used for construction, building purposes and making boats.

Odisha, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka.

Benefits
• Reduces damage in the event of natural calamities.

• Line planting in the coastal areas helps in controlling the wind force.


Casuarina plantation
• It is a suitable species for wasteland development because of its adaptability to a wide range of habitats,
fast growth, salt tolerant, drought resistant, ability to reclaim land and stabilise sand dunes.

Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests
Climatic Conditions
• Annual rainfall is 100-150 cm.

Characteristics
• These are similar to moist deciduous forests and shed their leaves in dry season.

• The major difference is that they can grow in areas of comparatively less rainfall.

• They represent a transitional type – moist deciduous on the wetter side and thorn forests on the drier side.

• They have closed but uneven canopy.

190


• The forests are composed of a mixture of a few species of deciduous trees rising up to a height of 20 me-
tres.

• The dry alpine scrub is the uppermost limit of scrub xerophytic, dwarf shrubs, over 3,500 metres above sea
level and found in the dry zone. Juniper, honeysuckle, artemesia etc. are important species.

4. Biogeography – Soils
• Soil is the thin top layer on the earth’s crust comprising rock particles mixed with organic matter.

• Pedology is the study of soils in their natural environment.

• Pedogenesis is the natural process of soil formation that includes a variety of processes such as weather-
ing, leaching, calcification etc.

• The Soil formation is mainly related to the parent rock material, surface relief, climate and natural vegeta-
tion.

4.1 Soil Types: Sandy, Clayey & Loamy
• The soil is classified on the basis of the proportion of particles of various sizes.

1) If the soil contains a greater proportion of big particles, it is called sandy soil.

2) If the proportion of fine particles is relatively higher, then it is called clayey soil.

3) If the amount of large and fine particles is about the same, then the soil is called loamy.

• Water can drain quickly through the spaces between the sand particles.

• So, sandy soils tend to be light in colour, well aerated and dry.

• Clay particles, being much smaller, pack tightly together, leaving little space for air.

• Unlike sandy soil, water can be held in the tiny gaps between the particles of clay.

• So, clay soils have little air. But they are heavy as they hold more water than the sandy soils.

• The best topsoil for growing plants is loam.

• Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as silt.

• Silt occurs as a deposit in river beds. The size of the silt particles is between those of sand and clay.

• The loamy soil also has humus in it. It has the right water holding capacity for the growth of plants.

• Clayey and loamy soils are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat, and gram. Such soils are
good at retaining water.

• For paddy, soils rich in clay and organic matter and having a good capacity to retain water are ideal.

• For lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils, which drain water easily, are required.

• For cotton, sandy loam or loam, which drain water easily and can hold plenty of air, are more suita-
ble.

4.2 Soil Profile (Soil Horizon)
195


• A vertical section through different layers of the soil is called the soil profile.

• Each layer differs in feel (texture), colour, depth and chemical composition.

• These layers are referred to as horizons.

• A soil horizon is a layer generally parallel to the soil surface, whose physical characteristics differ from the
layers above and beneath.

• Horizons are defined in most cases by obvious physical features, chiefly colour and texture.

• The uppermost horizon is generally dark in colour as it is rich in humus and minerals.

• The humus makes the soil fertile and provides nutrients to growing plants.

• This layer is generally soft, porous and can retain more water. It is called the topsoil or the A-horizon.

• The next layer has a lesser amount of humus but more of minerals.

• This layer is generally harder and more compact and is called the B-horizon or the middle layer.

• The third layer is the C-horizon, which is made up of small lumps of rocks with cracks.

196


Soil Profile (Soil Horizon)
O Horizon
• Layers dominated by organic material.

• Some O layers consist of undecomposed or partially decomposed litter (such as leaves, needles, twigs,
moss, and lichens).

• They may be on top of either mineral or organic soils.

A Horizon or Surface soil
• It is part of the top soil.

• In this layer, organic matter is mixed with mineral matter.

197


• It is the layer of mineral soil with the most organic matter accumulation and soil life.

• This layer is depleted of (eluviated of) iron, clay, aluminium, organic compounds, and other soluble constit-
uents.

• When depletion is pronounced, a lighter coloured "E" subsurface soil horizon is apparent at the base of the
"A" horizon.

E horizon
• "E" stands for an eluviated layer.

• It is the horizon that has been significantly leached of clay, iron, and aluminium oxides, which leaves a con-
centration of resistant minerals, such as quartz, in the sand and silt sizes.

• These are present only in older, well-developed soils, and generally, occur between the A and B horizons.

B Horizon or Subsoil
• It is a subsurface layer reflecting a chemical or physical alteration of parent material.

• This layer accumulates all the leached minerals from A and E horizon.

• Thus iron, clay, aluminium and organic compounds accumulate in this horizon (illuviation (opposite of elu-
viation)).

C Horizon or Parent rock
• Weathered parent material accumulates in this layer, i.e. the parent material in sedimentary deposits.

• It is a layer of large unbroken rocks.

• This layer may accumulate more soluble compounds (inorganic material).

R Horizon or Bedrock
• This layer denotes the layer of partially weathered bedrock at the base of the soil profile.

• Unlike the above layers, R horizons largely comprise continuous masses of hard rock.

• Soils formed in situ will exhibit strong similarities to this bedrock layer.

• These areas of bedrock are under 50 feet of the other profiles.

4.3 Factors that influence soil formation in Indian Conditions
198


Parent Material
• The rocks from which soils are formed are called parent materials.

• In most of the cases, the parent material determines the colouration, mineral composition and texture
of the soil.

• In some cases, the soil formed may or may not have the same physical properties as the parent rock.

• Climatic factors induce chemical changes which also affect the physical properties of the soil.

• The surface rocks are exposed to the process of weathering. In this process, the rocks are converted into
fine grains and provide a base for the soil formation.

• In Indian Conditions, parent material is generally categorized into:
1. Ancient crystalline and metamorphic rocks
2. Cuddapah and Vindhyan rocks
3. Gondwana rocks
4. Deccan basalts
5. Tertiary and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of extra peninsular India {Rock System}
Ancient crystalline and metamorphic rocks
• They are the Oldest rocks (pre-Cambrian era) (formed due to solidification of molten magma about 4 bil-
lion years ago).

• They form the ‘Basement Complex’ of peninsular India.

• They are basically granites, gneisses and schists.

• These rocks are rich in ferromagnetic materials and give rise to red soils on weathering.

199


• The red colour of these soils is due to the presence of iron oxide.

Cuddapah and Vindhyan rocks
• They are ancient sedimentary rocks (4000 m thick).

• On weathering they give calcareous (containing calcium carbonate) and argillaceous (consisting of or con-
taining clay) soils.

• The soil is mostly devoid of metalliferous minerals.

Gondwana rocks
• These rocks are also sedimentary in nature, and they are much younger.

• On weathering, they give rise to comparatively less mature soils.

• The soil is more or less of uniform character but of low fertility.

Deccan basalts
• A volcanic outburst over a vast area of Peninsular India gave rise to Deccan Traps.

• Basaltic lava flowed out of fissures covering a vast area of about ten lakh sq km.

• Basalts are rich in titanium, magnetite, aluminium and magnesium.

• Consequently, the weathering of these rocks has given rise to soils of darker colour.

• The soil is fertile with high moisture holding capacity and is popularly known as regur or black cotton
soil.

Tertiary and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks
• Rocks of extra peninsular (plains and Himalayas) India have given rise to soils with high porosity.

• These soils are generally immature recent and sub recent rocks, result in alluvial soils on weathering.

• Alluvial fertile soils consist of fine silts and clay. These soils have little relation with the original rocks.

• On the other hand, the soils of the peninsular plateau are generally coarse-grained and are closely re-
lated to the parent rocks. The peninsular soils are generally less fertile.

Relief
• The relief is the most important factor for soil formation in places with steep slopes like the hilly regions,
edges of plateaus etc.

200


• Soil erosion on barren slopes is rampant, and it hinders soil formation. Example: Chambal ravines, higher
reaches of the Himalayas where there is minimal or no forest cover (most on the steep southern slopes) etc.

• The areas of low relief or gentle slope generally experience deposition and have deep soils. Example: Indo-
Gangetic plain.

• The exceptions in the plateau are river basins where the soil layers are sufficiently deep.

Climate
• Temperature and rainfall are the most important factors in soil formation.

• They determine the effectiveness of weathering of the parent material, the quantity of water seeping
through the soil and the type of micro-organisms present therein.

• Two different parent materials may develop the same soil in the same type of climate.

• Similarly, the same parent material may produce two different types of soils in two different types of cli-
mates.

• The crystalline granites produce laterite (reddish clayey soils) soil in relatively moist parts of the
monsoonal region and non-laterite soil in drier areas.

• Hot summer and low rainfall develop black soil as is found in some parts of Tamil Nadu irrespective
of the parent rock.

• In Rajasthan, both granite and sandstone give birth to sandy soil under arid climate.

• In arid and semi-arid regions, evaporation always exceeds precipitation. There is little vegetation, and the
soils badly lack humus content. Hence the soils are invariably of light colour.

• In Rajasthan and the adjoining arid and semi-arid regions, an excess of evaporation makes soils lime ac-
cumulating.

• Hence the soil is pedocal in nature (It is a class of soil which forms in semiarid and arid regions. It is rich in
calcium carbonate and has low soil organic matter).

• In cold climates of the Himalayan region, the process of vegetation decay is very slow, and the soils are
acidic in nature.

In areas of heavy rainfall and high temperature, the soils are red or lateritic. Why?

• Torrential rainfall during the rainy season washes the upper soil and leaches the materials into the deeper
horizon.

• During the dry summer season, the evaporation exceeds precipitation, and through capillary action, iron
and aluminium oxides are transported to the surface making the soil red.

201


• In areas of alternate wet and dry climate, the leached material which goes deep down in the horizon is
brought up, and the blazing sun bakes the topsoil so hard that it resembles a brick.

• Therefore, this soil is called lateritic which means brick.

Natural Vegetation
• Natural vegetation reflects the combined effects of relief and climate.

• The formation and development of soil is very much influenced by the growth of vegetation.

• The decayed leaf material adds much-needed humus to soil thereby increasing its fertility.

• The densely forested areas contain some of the best soils in India.

• There is a close relationship between the vegetation types and soil types in India.

4.4 Major Soil Groups of India
• Geologically, Indian soils can broadly be divided into soils of peninsular India and soils of extra-peninsular
India.

• The soils of Peninsular India are formed by the decomposition of rocks in situ, i.e. directly from the
underlying rocks.

• Soils of Peninsular India are transported and re-deposited to a limited extent and are known as sedentary
soils.

• The soils of the Extra-Peninsula (Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plains) are formed due to the deposi-
tional work of rivers and wind. They are very deep. They are often referred to as transported or azonal
soils.

• Major soil groups:
(1) Alluvial soils
(2) Black soils
(3) Red soils
(4) Laterite and Lateritic soils
(5) Forest and Mountain soils
(6) Arid and Desert soils
(7) Saline and Alkaline soils
(8) Peaty and Marshy soils
202


Major Soil Groups of India
Alluvial Soils
• Alluvial soils are formed mainly due to silt deposited by Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra rivers (transport-
ed or azonal soils).

• In coastal regions, some alluvial deposits are formed due to wave action.

• Rocks of the Himalayas form the parent material.

• They are the largest soil group covering about 15 lakh sq km or about 45.6 per cent of the total area.

• They support more than 40% of India’s population by providing the most productive agricultural lands.

Characteristics of Alluvial Soils
203


• They are immature and have weak profiles due to their recent origin.

• Most of the soil is loamy. Sandy and clayey soils are not uncommon.

• Pebbly and gravelly soils are rare.

• Kankar (calcareous concretions) beds are present in some regions along the river terraces.

• The soil is porous because of its loamy (equal proportion of sand and clay) nature.

• Porosity and texture provide good drainage and other conditions favourable for agriculture.

• These soils are constantly replenished by the recurrent floods.

Chemical properties of Alluvial Soils
• The proportion of nitrogen is generally low.

• The proportion of potash, phosphoric acid (phosphate) and alkalis (lime) are adequate.

• The proportion of Iron oxide and lime vary within a wide range.

Distribution of Alluvial Soils in India
• They occur all along the Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plains except in few places where the top layer is
covered by desert sand.

• They also occur in deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery, where they are called
deltaic alluvium (coastal alluvium).

• Some alluvial soils are found in the Narmada, Tapti valleys and Northern parts of Gujarat.

Crops in Alluvial Soils
• They are mostly flat and regular soils and are best suited for agriculture.

• They are best suited to irrigation and respond well to the canal and well/tube-well irrigation.

• They yield splendid crops of rice, wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, jute, maize, oilseeds, etc.

Geological Divisions of alluvial soils
• Geologically, the alluvium of the Great plain of India is divided into newer or younger khadar and older
bhangar soils.

Black Soils
• The parent material for most of the black soil are the volcanic rocks that were formed in the Deccan Plateau
(Deccan and the Rajmahal trap).

204


• In Tamil Nadu, gneisses and schists form the parent material. The former are sufficiently deep while the lat-
er are generally shallow.

• These are the region of high temperature and low rainfall. It is, therefore, a soil group typical to the dry
and hot regions of the Peninsula.

Characteristics of Black Soils
• A typical black soil is highly argillaceous (containing clay) with a large clay factor, 62 per cent or more.

• In general, black soils of uplands are of low fertility while those in the valleys are very fertile.

• The black soil is highly retentive of moisture.

• It swells greatly on accumulating moisture.

• In the rainy season, the soil gets very sticky and hence ploughing, and other agricultural activities demand
more effort.

• In summer, the moisture evaporates the soil shrinks and is seamed with broad and deep cracks.

• The lower layers can still retain moisture. The cracks permit oxygenation of the soil to sufficient depths.

Colour of Black Soils
• The black colour is due to the presence of a small proportion of titaniferous magnetite or iron and black
constituents of the parent rock.

• In Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, the black colour is derived from crystalline schists and basic
gneisses.

• Various tints of the black colour may be found in this group of soils.

Chemical Composition of Black Soils
• 10 per cent of alumina,
• 9-10 per cent of iron oxide,
• 6-8 per cent of lime and magnesium carbonates,
• potash is variable (less than 0.5 per cent) and
• phosphates, nitrogen and humus are low.

Distribution of Black Soils
• Spread over 5.46 lakh sq km (16.6 per cent of the total area) across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, parts
of Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.

205


Crops in Black Soils
• These soils are best suited for cotton crop. Hence these soils are called as regur and black cotton soils.

• Other major crops grown on the black soils include wheat, jowar, linseed, virginia tobacco, castor, sunflower
and millets.

• Rice and sugarcane are equally important where irrigation facilities are available.

• Large varieties of vegetables and fruits are also successfully grown on the black soils.

• This soil has been used for growing a variety of crops for centuries without adding fertilisers and manures,
with little or no evidence of exhaustion.

Red Soils
• Red soils along with its minor groups form one of the largest soil group of India.

• The main parent rocks are crystalline and metamorphic rocks like acid granites, gneisses and quartzites.

Characteristics of Red Soils
• The texture of these soils can vary from sand to clay, the majority being loams.

• On the uplands, the red soils are poor, gravelly, and porous. But in the lower areas, they are rich, deep dark
and fertile.

Chemical Composition of Red Soils
• They are acidic mainly due to the nature of the parent rocks. The alkali content is fair.

• They are poor in lime, magnesia, phosphates, nitrogen and humus.

• They are fairly rich in potash and potassium.

Colour of Red Soils
• The red colour is due to the presence of iron oxide.

• The colour is more due to the wide diffusion rather than the high percentage of iron oxide content.

Distribution of Red Soils
• These soils mostly occur in the regions of low rainfall.

• They occupy about 3.5 lakh sq km (10.6 per cent) of the total area of the country.

• These soils are spread on almost the whole of Tamil Nadu.

206


• Other regions with red soil include parts of Karnataka, south-east of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pra-
desh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Chota Nagpur plateau; parts of south Bihar, West Bengal, Ut-
tar Pradesh; Aravallis and the eastern half of Rajasthan (Mewar or Marwar Plateau), parts of North-Eastern
states.

Crops in Red Soils
• The red soils are mostly loamy and hence cannot retain water like the black soils.

• The red soils, with the proper use of fertilisers and irrigation techniques, give a good yield of cotton, wheat,
rice, pulses, millets, tobacco, oilseeds, potatoes and fruits.

Laterite – Lateritic Soils
• Laterite soils are mostly the end products of weathering.

• They are formed under conditions of high temperature and heavy rainfall with alternate wet and dry
periods.

• Heavy rainfall promotes leaching (nutrients gets washed away by water) of soil whereby lime and silica
are leached away, and a soil rich in oxides of iron and aluminium compounds is left behind.

• ‘Laterite’ means brick in Latin. They harden greatly on losing moisture.

• Laterite soils are red in colour due to little clay and more gravel of red sand-stones.

The chemical composition of Laterite – Lateritic Soils
• Laterite soils are rich in bauxite or ferric oxides.

• They are very poor in lime, magnesia, potash and nitrogen.

• Sometimes, the phosphate content may be high in the form of iron phosphate.

• In wetter places, there may be higher content of humus.

Distribution of Laterite – Lateritic Soils
• Laterite soils cover an area of 2.48 lakh sq km.

• The continuous stretch of laterite soil is found on the summits of Western Ghats at 1000 to 1500 m above
mean sea level, Eastern Ghats, the Rajmahal Hills, Vindhyan, Satpuras and Malwa Plateau.

• They are well developed in south Maharashtra, parts of Karnataka etc. and are widely scattered in other re-
gions.

207


Crops in Laterite – Lateritic Soils
• Laterite soils lack fertility due to intensive leaching.

• When manured and irrigated, some laterites are suitable for growing plantation crops like tea, coffee, rub-
ber, cinchona, coconut, arecanut, etc.

• In some areas, these soils support grazing grounds and scrub forests.

The economic value of Laterite – Lateritic Soils
• Laterite and lateritic soils provide valuable building material.

• These soils can be easily cut into cakes but hardens like iron when exposed to air.

• As it is the end-product of weathering, it cannot be weathered much further and is durable.

Forest – Mountain Soils
• These soils occupy about 2.85 lakh sq km or 8.67% of the total land area of India.

• They are mainly heterogeneous soils found on the hill slopes covered by forests.

• The formation of these soils is mainly governed by the characteristic deposition of organic matter derived
from forests and their character changes with parent rocks, ground-configuration and climate.

• Consequently, they differ greatly even if they occur in close proximity to one another.

Distribution of Forest – Mountain Soils
• In the Himalayan region, such soils are mainly found in valleys, less steep and north facing slopes. The
south-facing slopes are very steep and exposed to denudation and hence do not support soil formation.

• Forest soils occur in Western and Eastern Ghats also.

Chemical properties of Forest – Mountain Soils
• The forest soils are very rich in humus.

• They are deficient in potash, phosphorus and lime.

• They require a good deal of fertilisers for high yields.

Crops in Forest – Mountain Soils
• They are suitable for plantations of tea, coffee, spices and tropical fruits in the peninsular forest region.

• Wheat, maize, barley and temperate fruits are grown in the Himalayan forest region.

208


Arid – Desert Soils
• The desert soils consist of aeolian sand (90 to 95 per cent) and clay (5 to 10 per cent).

• They cover a total area of 1.42 lakh sq km (4.32%).

• The presence of sand inhibits soil growth.

• Desertification of neighbouring soils is common due to the intrusion of aeolian sand (wind action).

Distribution of Arid – Desert Soils
• Occur in arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.

• The sand here is blown from the Indus basin and the coast by the prevailing south-west monsoon winds.

• Sandy soils without clay factor are also common in coastal regions of Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Chemical properties of Arid – Desert Soils
• They are usually poor in organic matter.

• Some desert soils are alkaline with varying degree of soluble salts like calcium carbonate.

• Calcium content increases downwards, and the subsoil has ten times more calcium.

• The phosphate content of these soils is as high as in normal alluvial soils.

• Nitrogen is originally low, but some of it is available in the form of nitrates.

Crops of Arid – Desert Soils
• Phosphates and nitrates make these soils fertile wherever moisture is available.

• There is a possibility of reclaiming these soils if proper irrigation facilities are available.

• In large areas, only the drought resistant and salt tolerant crops such as barley, cotton, millets, maize and
pulses are grown.

Saline – Alkaline Soils
• In Saline and Alkaline Soils, the topsoil is impregnated (soak or saturate with a substance) with saline and
alkaline efflorescences (become covered with salt particles).

• Undecomposed rock fragments, on weathering, give rise to sodium, magnesium and calcium salts and
sulphurous acid.

• Some of the salts are transported in solution by the rivers.

209


• In regions with the low water table, the salts percolate into subsoil and in regions with good drainage,
the salts are wasted away by flowing water.

• But in places where the drainage system is poor, the water with high salt concentration becomes stagnant
and deposits all the salts in the topsoil once the water evaporates.

• In regions with the high sub-soil water table, injurious salts are transferred from below by the capillary
action as a result of evaporation in the dry season.

Capillary action
• Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in op-
position to, external forces like gravity.

• The force behind capillary action is surface tension.

Surface tension
• Surface tension is the elastic tendency of liquids (a membrane-like surface) that makes them acquire the
least surface area possible.

• Surface tension causes insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on the wa-
ter surface.


• Surface tension offers the necessary buoyant force (buoyancy) required for an object to float in water (Ships
float because of difference in density as well as surface tension).


210


What gives water droplet its shape?

• When a water droplet is freely falling, it acquires a spherical shape.

• When a water drop is on a surface, it acquires the shape of a hemisphere (half a sphere).

• All this is due to surface tension.


This kind of trivial GK can help with many exams.

Distribution of Saline – Alkaline Soils
• Saline and Alkaline Soils occupy 68,000 sq km of area.

• These soils are found in canal irrigated areas and areas of a high sub-soil water table.

• Parts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab (side effects of im-
proper or excess irrigation), Rajasthan and Maharashtra have this kind of soils.

• The accumulation of these salts makes the soil infertile and renders it unfit for agriculture.

• In Gujarat, the areas around the Gulf of Khambhat are affected by the sea tides carrying salt-laden depos-
its. Vast areas comprising the estuaries of the Narmada, the Tapi, the Mahi and the Sabarmati have thus be-
come infertile.

• Along the coastline, saline sea waters infiltrate into coastal regions during storm surges (when cyclones
make landfall) and make the soil unfit for cultivation.

• The low lying regions of coastal Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu face this kind of soil degradation.

Peaty – Marshy Soils
• These are soils with a large amount of organic matter and a considerable amount of soluble salts.

• The most humid regions have this type of soil.

• They are black, heavy and highly acidic.

Distribution of Peaty – Marshy Soils
• Kottayam and Alappuzha districts of Kerala.

211


• Also occur in the coastal areas of Odisha and Tamil Nadu, Sundarbans of West Bengal, in Bihar and Almora
district of Uttarakhand.

Chemical Properties of Peaty – Marshy Soils
• They are deficient in potash and phosphate.

Crops of Peaty – Marshy Soils
• Most of the peaty soils are under water during the rainy season but as soon the rains cease; they are put
under paddy cultivation.
